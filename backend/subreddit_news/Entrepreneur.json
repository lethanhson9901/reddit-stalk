            "text": "I have a SaaS product and this tech influencer wants $10k for one post. They have 1M followers and decent engagement in the tech space. Most of their content is about general tech though (product reviews both hardware and software). I've seen others charge way more but also way less. \n\nSome people are telling me to go with micro influencers instead. Has anyone had any success with these big influencers? Would it be better if I promoted it with a bunch of smaller creators instead of one big creator? ",

I\u2019ve worked with a bunch of influencers (albeit they were for promoting music festivals so an easy sell) that would want upfront payment. We had a fairly large budget but 99% of the time digital ads work the best. Hell TikTok ads has always yielded great success so I\u2019d say money better spent that way.\n\nAdditionally we would try to calculate CPM for these influencers based on how much they were asking and getting an average on how many view they would get on past promoted posts. This gave us a way better idea of what we could expect in return.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a large budget ads are the way to go. Much easier to track and they have been a proven success many times. \n\nIf set on using influencers make sure you have a way to track via affiliate links to really see if the project was effective or not.\n\nAlso not a fucking chance I\u2019m paying 10k for someone with a million followers. 10k for probably 100k views is insanity $100 CPM maybe if you\u2019re selling attorney services in NYC that would be somewhat okay but for a SaaS product you better off putting that 10k all on black in Vegas"

Then rip those metrics into a 1/3rd or less to apply as a test model to the larger influencers numbers.   \n  \nPersonally I just finished working with 3 influencer agencies, individual midsized influencers and several individual micro-influencers and because my product is $$$ for a niche the microinfluencers are usually worth their weight in gold but time consuming to reach out to and contract.\n\nOn the opposite end I spent $6k on a larger influencer and it returned $0, she was horribly entitled and delivered really trashy results.

Larger accounts easily get multiple times that for short form posts. \n\nYou still need to optimise your offer and test if it works well with this type of marketing though rather than just paying someone and hoping it returns a multiple on your investment. Longer term partnerships across multiple videos build a lot more trust with an audience that\u2019s why a lot of creators have recurring sponsors regularly as opposed to one offs every other week. \n\nI would recommend starting smaller with a couple smaller accounts and testing out what type of video you want made, your offer and landing page to best convince viewers about checking out your product. It\u2019s not like the viewers are programmed to go and buy your product just because it\u2019s in a video that you paid someone a bunch of money to be in, still takes testing things out and optimising just like a normal advert. \n\nHopefully that gets you close to at least breakeven on some of those accounts and then go from there with offering them an affiliate program so that you have a longer term collaboration to optimise the way you collaborate and the conversion rates to grow profitability on that partnership"

You don't even know the right questions to ask. ( don't worry it's VERY typical )\n\nYou need some serious representation on this front. Someone who can crawl up their ass and make sure you're getting exceptional value for your spend.  SOMEONE WITH PROVEN SUCCESS IN YOUR SECTOR.... Pissing money into the wind is like candy for predatory \"marketing influencers\"\n\nBelieve me, engaging someone will SAVE you a shitload of money, as well as get you results and save you a lot of suffering and frustration.\n\nAs others have said, build-in incentive for them in the deal so they push it for real.. but honestly, find someone that'll make sure you set it up so you get results or you're more than likely get fucked bad.\n\nAlso, this should be only one facet of a very serious and detailed GTM strategy... or you're just shooting in the dark.\n\nBest of luck!"

            "text": "General gist of it is my brother came up with an idea years back revolving reselling an online good. He was in college at the time, made a killing off of it. Now, he\u2019s working a full time job and still runs this business on the side but not to the same extent.\n\nMy best friend in HS and I started running this same business recently and had great success. Told my brother at the beginning - he was quite supportive and congratulated us on figuring it out. Because we had two people running the business, we were able to make much more than my brother has ever had just simply bc the business requires a lot of manual effort.\n\nLast month we brought in 18k in profit. The month before we brought in 16k. It\u2019s looking like pretty much every month we will make 15k+ in profit. And we just expanded to hiring our first employee to help automate some manual processes.\n\nJust two days ago I get a call from my brother telling me he wanted me to stop. He mentioned changes in the market + that he felt uncomfortable. I asked him what changes he saw, and he kinda just skirted around the question and just said he felt uncomfortable.\n\nI asked if it made sense if we just teamed up to dominate the market. He said no, that he just wanted to work on it himself and that it was his idea.\n\nI think I\u2019m going to stop. It sucks because it\u2019s a huge amount of income, but it\u2019s not worth it ruining my relationship with him. Just curious what you guys think and why he might want me to stop.",

Neither of us is still in hs.\n\nRegarding the other stuff - should\u2019ve used a burner account \ud83d\ude02\n\nIt\u2019s not an illegal business, and it\u2019s not a sneaker business. I do run a sneaker reselling business as well, but it makes far less income. There is no illegality drugs etc. not sure where everyone is getting illegal stuff from. Honestly kind of annoyed about it.\n\nThe uncomfortable part is something I don\u2019t really know. As other people suggested, I would lean towards jealously. But another thing I thought about is that I would not have thought of this idea in a million years.\n\nMy brother is a genius. I consider myself decently smart, but my brother just thinks differently. Like the dude will be a millionaire or even billionaire. I\u2019m positive of it. \n\nHe wouldn\u2019t have mentioned this idea to anyone I think if he knew they were going to do it. He just talked about it around family bc I think he thought that he could trust us. So, when I started the business, I did feel guilty because I thought he would disapprove. But, when I told him about it - initially he was super supportive and congratulated me on figuring out.\n\nWhen he did the 180 a few days ago I was shocked although there were some warning signs. Whenever I asked him questions about the business he would shut me down. If I looked at his computer ever he would close it. In general, he was very closed off from helping me at all and oftentimes would tell me he wouldn\u2019t want to talk about the business.\n\nConversely, with him, I was very open about what me and my friend were doing. I offered to give him certain sources that I thought he wasn\u2019t already doing. I was incredibly appreciative of the fact that he came up with the idea and always felt like I needed to repay him.\n\nI can\u2019t really figure out what he means by uncomfortable until I ask him. But I do for sure understand why he would feel that way."

Offer him to work together and to expand this the 3 of you. If this will be the case, make a very very detailed and strict shareholders agreement, who owned that, who gets what, etc. To avoid future conflicts. \n\n2. Ask him if he would like to buy your operation out? Be friendly, tell him how much work you put in, how hard you have worked for it.\n\n3. Split the geolocations where you sell - cities, states, whatever. Expand until you reached the cap. Then talk with him again.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to come up with the original idea and of course he feels like this particular idea is his \u201cbaby\u201d, so he is probably a bit upset.

The only part that is \"quasi\" is that I source my items SOMETIMES from websites that tell people not to resell their items. Besides that though everything else is legit.\n\nThere is a shit ton of bullshit I deal with everyday. It's a lot of manual work. A lot of buying --> focus is on moving high volumes of stuff for low margins. We buy around 1500-1600 of these a month, sell around 1200, refund the rest, and make about 10-15 dollars per item. It's very difficult to automate and requires multiple people to keep track of all the moving processes.\n\n  \nI am very glad to be in a position where I can choose whether to continue this or not, but I'm not sure how sustainable this business is. As mentioned, it could die out within 5-10 years if other people figure it out; it's not some revolutionary SaaS service. So, I think it's incredibly risky to put all my ideas in this one basket, which is maybe why I'm don't seem devestated about stopping.\n\nDon't get me wrong though - making an extra 80-90k a year would help a fuck ton. I'm 24 years old and at this point this is life changing money.",

            "text": "One of the things I think first time founders get wrong imo is that they not only wait too long to launch but also put way too much effort and time into their launch.\n\nThis mistake I believe is mostly because most of them assume launching is a one time thing. Yet, the truth is, you can launch over and over again in same and different places. And for each time, you get to iterate messaging, product and pricing based on all the learnings from the previous launch.\n\nIn fact, I recommend doing this to almost anyone who is getting started. And here is exactly how we did it.\n\n1. Every week, we published a completely new landing page under a new domain based on learnings from previous launch\n2. We then launched it on Product Hunt, Hackernews and Reddit.\n3. For product hunt launch, if you can afford, use an agency like tetriz to guarantee a top 5 spot since they usually have a network that will upvote for you. Alternatively, if you have a strong linkedIn, that helps to create some early traction.\n4. For reddit, you can either choose subreddits that allow promotion or again hire an agency like krankly who can work around the rules using certain black hat tactics (grey area but works)\n5. We repeated this almost 13 times now\n6. Our first few launches gave us like $100 in MRR\n7. By our 7th launch, we were making $1k in MRR per launch\n8. And as of today we have $10k in MRR\n\nHope this helps. If you have any questions, just let me know below :)",

Just ways to approach a sales pitch, a bit about sales tunnels and work on your email writing skills as well. Then create a very strong cold email that you will adjust for each outreach you make. Open LinkedIn and company wall site or just reach out to local businesses in your area offering your services. After you make your first sale it usually picks up from there with much faster pace.. the first one is the hardest one. Also in this area networking is quite important. So check some business meet ups and conferences in your area that you are able to attend. \nThat\u2019s what I would suggest as a start in sales :D"

If you are able to bring results to clients then it\u2019s different from those presenting themselves as professionals when in reality they don\u2019t make results or bring value to clients.  They won\u2019t be making a lot (if any) money and they are just selling smoke which becomes quite obvious very soon. Digital marketing is not simply posting a reel on instagram. So if you dive deeper into the subject and learn those skills properly it will produce income. Another skill that\u2019s very profitable to have is Sales. You can reach out to bunch of companies that sell goods or services and offer b2b sales service based on commission. Companies tend to agree on that since it\u2019s without an actual cost to them, and let\u2019s say you find a client for a software development company- those projects are expensive and you can walk away with quite a commission."

Some of these models require at least 24GB GPU VRAM per instance, especially when running larger versions like Llama 13B or Falcon. Ideally I\u2019d also like to finetune these models locally for specialized tasks.\n\nI want to start with the minimum cost possible and have a dev with me, so a setup that doesn\u2019t require too many backend requirements would be ideal. Looking for suggestions on the best GPU workstation to start with. Hope to get ideas from you guys. Thanks so much!",

I found a butterfly bouquet set from China to resell. I made a website, I bought the product, filmed ads, etc..  I did all the work, but I started to doubt myself. I kept seeing posts online of people saying that dropshipping was dead, and let a bunch of different creators online get into my head about the fact that my product wouldn\u2019t sell. I was also very anxious because I\u2019m not the type of person to share my face online, so I was worried people would make fun of me.\n\nFast forward to this year, sales for this product are exploding online. I saw a single TikTok shop that made 60 grand in revenue. And there are many others selling the same thing.\n\nHonestly, a huge reason that I gave up was just insecurity and self-doubt. I come from a non-business background. I let my self doubt kill my ideas because I convinced myself they weren\u2019t good enough.\n\nThis year, I\u2019ll be starting an online business again, and I will NOT give up this time. Take this as your sign to do the same.\n\nAlso just FYI, if anybody is interested in connecting, feel free to DM me. I\u2019m looking to break into online business, and would like to know more people in the space. \n\nGood luck ",

We discuss prices, outline plans, and everything feels set to start a great partnership. However, after that initial enthusiasm, many clients suddenly disappear no messages, no calls, nothing. It\u2019s not about the price, as they seem to agree with our quotes.\n\nRecently, a tire detailing store owner reached out to us needing a POS system (if I remember correctly). We thoroughly discussed his requirements and provided a detailed quote. He was very serious and ready to move forward, but then he started ghosting us. Despite multiple follow-ups, we never received a response.\n\nAll I\u2019m asking for is a bit of respect and basic communication. If your circumstances change or you decide not to proceed, at least let others know. It helps them save time and focus our efforts elsewhere. I understand that not every lead will convert, but a straightforward update would be greatly appreciated.\n\nHow do you handle people who ghost you after showing initial interest?\n\n",

            "author": "moretimeoffline",
            "text": "Something that I've learned thats really helped me as an entrepreneur (that I don't hear much), is to be\u00a0**intentional.**\n\nWhile working hard is important, what you\u2019re actually working on is much more important.\n\nA scary but beautiful reality of entrepreneurship, is that you can work on\u00a0*anything.*\n\nThere's nobody telling you what you should be doing, and because of this, it is very important that you're intentional about what you're working on. Because there are many entrepreneurs working hard on things or projects that aren\u2019t putting them on trajectory to reach their goals.\n\nFor example, someone may dream of being a millionaire, but they live a lifestyle that won't take them there, regardless of how hard they\u2019re working. \n\nThey may be working very hard, but it may be on the wrong things.\n\nI think this likely happens because we\u2019re so distracted, with TV, social media, video games, etc.\u00a0\n\nWe fill the entirety of our free time with distractions, and never take the time to think about where we want to go in our lives, and whether or not our current routine takes us there.\n\nMost entrepreneurs, once they\u2019ve been established and can get by financially, tend to begin thinking **inward**.\n\nWhat I mean by thinking inward, is thinking only in terms of their actual position.\n\nEssentially they become indulged in what their business is, and don\u2019t think about what their business could be, and they get stuck.\n\nI heard once, that it\u2019s lazier to work a 9-5 until retirement, than it is to spend just 3 years starting a successful business. And this is true! Because this requires you to be\u00a0**intentional**\u00a0in an unintentional and distracted world. This is not easy to do, but it is responsible for bringing me to where i\u2019ve gotten in my years of entrepreneurship.\n\nHard work will never substitute a bad plan, the same way good marketing can never substitute a product nobody wants.\n\nMy lesson is to look at what you\u2019re doing and where you\u2019re headed, ask yourself where you would be if you repeated your daily routine for 365 days, or even 10 years. will this take your business where you want to be? These are great questions to frequently ask yourself and reassess\n\nThis is something i\u2019ve learned that helps keep me on track, and it has kept me doing things that bring me closer to where i want to be in my life. I hope my lesson has taught you something too.\n\nI would love to read the comments and hear what everyone else thinks about this too!\n\n**P.s.**\u00a0I learned this from moretimeoffline+com, they have much more similar advice for entrepreneurs like this for free (called Neuroproductivity). If you enjoyed this, then you\u2019ll love the stuff there.\n\nHope this helps! cheers :)",

Tech folks get approached all the time by founders with an idea who'd love to split equity in return for work.\n\nThe problem is that the idea is 2% of the business. The other 98% are building and selling (or marketing for B2C), split roughly evenly.\n\nSo what a potential tech guy is looking for isn't someone with a good idea, but someone who can sell. Because tech people hate selling and typically avoid it like the plague, but recognize its necessary for a business to work out.\n\nSo that's the deal - you want tech people to chase you to join your startup? You need to show them you can sell. If you have clients lined up with wallets open and ready to pay (or even better - have already paid something up front), you'll have no problem finding a tech partner.\n\nBut if you can neither sell nor code, you've got a bit of a learning curve to go through. And I recommend learning how to sell - it's way easier than coding (I've been a dev for 25 years and have been selling for 5).",

Figured out how much money you can reasonably expect to make - and compared that with the cost ($5K? $20K? $100K?) or developing your service?   Let's say you can get everything working for $50K.  Is the income going to surpass that? \n\nIf you are CERTAIN  - then:\n\n\\- Draw pictures of the APP, make a presentation, and go show it to a couple of potential customers.  Tell them you are NOT trying to sell this to them. Just wanting their input on your idea - and then ask them what it might be worth to them (monthly, yearly, whatever).  \n\n\\- Adjust your economic projections based on their answers.  Maybe you over/underestimated the value of your idea.   (And you said it is a \"local\" idea... which I assume limits it's value.  If you can re-purpose to other \"local\" areas, obviously that greatly increase the value of your service. \n\n\\- If it's still worthwhile based on above, then write up a \"technical\" document that explains exactly what the service is (page 1)... and how the software/service would work.  I.e, show every screen your users would see, and explain to the computer programer(s) exactly what each screen and each button would do.  Draw pictures and notate them with arrows to each button, etc. \n\nYour software development costs increase with complexity.  E.g.,  if you have different levels of users (Admin, super user, basic user) that is more complex than a \"stand along\" system with only one type of user.  \n\n\\- Take your tech doc and find some developers to talk to.  Their pricing will be all over the place.  Make sure they have working examples of their work that demonstrate they know how to do what you need.  (E.g. Do you need 3 types of users? Have they done something with different types of users?)   If you go to them and say \"I need this (pointing to tech doc) can you do this?)\"  - you can figure out which can or can't do the project - then ask them to give you a price and a timeline.

It's working great and my beta program is prompting some minor changes that are easy to tweak. It's been exceptionally affordable, I won't share the price because that highly depends on complexity, but I got a quote for $120,000 for the same functionality which is insane (for my stage). \n\nConnect with them here: https://kealy.studio/\n\nBut I'd do everything you can with the tools you already use. The more you can get into an excel document or Airtable, graph paper etc will speed things up. That process helped me find some significant gaps in my idea before they were developed."

RESEARCH: Do some market research to confirm what features your buyers need, what pricing model would work, and what they might pay.  You could do this by taking a few people you trust out for lunches/coffee, and maybe even asking a few others you don't know as well. Also look online to see what competition you have, and what features/pricing they have.\n\n2. PLAN: Draft out a rough business/marketing plan - to make sure it'll make money, and that there's a good outline of how the product/service will work and generate revenue for you.  In this process, you can also decide how/who to fill the roles required of the business, if it's a go. \n\n3. EXECUTE: If AND ONLY IF the plan makes sense, and you're prepared to put in some effort, then you can proceed to 1) developing a brand for your product, and getting a web domain/site for it.  2) getting the money together (some of your old customers/connections might invest, or you can hit the banks, etc) and 2) contracting the programmers and building the product out.\n\n  \nMake sense?  If you're stuck, just ask."

Hire on Upwork - it's fairly simple to learn, but I doubt learning it would be the best use of your time right now.  \n\\- Talk to your connections, have them DEMO the product, ask for their honest feedback (what was confusing, what they liked, what they wish it did), ask how much time & money they saved/what they'd pay. Do *not* try to sell customers right now - feedback is infinitely more valuable at this stage than the few bucks you could get by selling customers on a half-baked product (that they'd probably leave after a few months anyway).  \n\\- Iterate product, onboarding, etc. w/ the feedback, launch a website, run some paid traffic to the website to test offer.  \n\\- Play around with different offers, audiences, etc. - see what connects.  \n\\- Onboard first few (paying) customers, use proof of concept to recruit a technical co-founder that can help you fully flesh out the product from MVP to scalable software.\n\nBest of luck, rooting for you."

I can help you get started! \n\nThe way forward would be to build an MVP (either a hi-fidelity figma mockup, or an actual MVP) and then show it to potential customers. Take feedback, iterate, and repeat. That's the only way to build out a SaaS. Given you relationships with decision makers, and industry-specific expertise, you can get a lot done on the none-technical side and the initial product design side."
