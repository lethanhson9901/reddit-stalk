Blackrock, Fidelity, etc are buying up a ton of BTC because they have to have a 1:1 value on their books as retail investors buy the ETFs. Are they counting this as institutional buys? I would consider the ETF inflows to be driven largely by retail investors buying the ETFs and the institutions are pretty much acting as a custodian.",

However, that should be true today as it was a year ago or in 2022/23. So can't completely discount it.\n\nAs a comparison, looking at google trends which would be a decent indicator of retail interest, bitcoin hit its three year peak the week of the election and this past week it was 65% of that peak."

It's not so much what is, it's what will be \n\nIt's a thought experiment\n\nJust looking at this chart though, if you blindly buy whenever there's a large drawdown in retail sentiment you only have one false signal meaning the probability of this indicator alone is pretty good. People are often the most bearish around the best times to buy. That's a crazy thought being at 100K. Whenever momentum stalls retail tends to get bearish, you can see this lining up the correlations. They like buying highs and momentum and they hate buying lows\n\nJanuary 2023 is probably the weirdest reading on the entire chart and I can't remember what the news headlines were then but I suspect there was something\n\nThis most recent bull market, every time the price goes on a run, retail sentiment is crashing, they expect a crash each time the price moves up, that's what's going on, we're just resetting for another push higher",

We went from less than 1% of the general population owning BTC straight to the most influential powers and sovereign nations positioned to hold it on their books. The door of opportunity for people to escape the system is closing. Most people, myself included, figured retail adoption would continue to grow with each cycle, outpacing that of big money until it became too big to ignore. This cycle seems to illustrate a different pattern regarding adoption in that perhaps mass retail adoption has been leapfrogged by large institutional money and nation state adoption. It\u2019s an unfortunate reality but there\u2019s only so much room on the raft."

I can only assume that for that user (not sure man or woman), the whole point was to push and promote BTC, they probably had 1000's+ BTC. A lot of people mined Bitcoin on low en laptops, and some people did it using their University servers (yep I knew someone that did that).\n\nI lost touch with anyone I knew that had a lot of BTC back in the day. I also know someone that I still keep in touch, that lost 115 BTC with Mt. Gox. For him 115 was a month or two salary, now is a whole different story. He never got back into it."

Market capitalization of Bitcoin represents the market value of all existing coins based on current price, not new wealth creation.\n\n\n3.

Electricity/environmental impacts aside (argument for another day), the more we mine in the US the more we are adding to GDP assuming people are willing to buy.\n\nMining BTC is nothing like the Feds printing.

You have to talk to different people, understand their perspectives, and make decision that\u2019s suitable for you.\n\nApple creates value by producing stuff that helps its users get their stuff done faster, helps run their business, etc and contributes to the overall economy. it\u2019s agreed that Apples stock price is the combination of its current utility plus speculation about its future utility. Apples pe ratio stands around 37%, so 37% of its current stock value is based on its current earnings, and the remainder can be attributed to speculation about its future earnings.\n\nIn case of bitcoin, it\u2019s interesting because there is no earnings that can be attributed to it. Only thing that the price is based on is the speculation of its future utility. \n\nNow whether you as an individual investor feel that bitcoin will be used as a major currency in future and believe in it, or you could be someone from buttcoin that don\u2019t believe in it, depends solely on you. Everyone will have different opinion based on their own investment philosophy \n\nSo in case of Apple there\u2019s less ambiguity about its value because a good chunk of its price is based on its current utility. So it has less perceived risk. In case of bitcoin, there is not much current uitility and most people are simply hoarding it as a store of value. So the price is driven more by speculation than anything else. So low risk investors stay away from it."

Bitcoin is very similar to housing supply where technically the number of houses increases slowly, but there is an overall restriction on the total number of houses that can exist because of land requirements. This is similar to Bitcoin in the sense that mining increases supply, but there's a restriction on the total number of coins that can exist. Now imagine a situation where owning Bitcoin is the same as owning a house. The issue with Bitcoin is that unlike housing, people can pick another currency to be their digital gold. there is nothing special about Bitcoin because it can be copied and pasted. In some future reality we're owning a Bitcoin is similar to owning a house the people out of the system don't have to buy into it they can simply create their own version that has the same functionality. This cannot happen with housing because there is a single block of land that exists, whereas in the digital space, there are infinite numbers of land to build a currency on. Just like young people have a resentment for old people owning all of the housing supply and driving up prices the same thing will happen with bitcoin but the difference is they don't have to buy into the system. first of all, it is not a necessity to own Bitcoin, and second of all, they can very easily create their own as a generation. \nI am happy to discuss this further.

It is interesting in the sense that their position may be softening a bit as far as seeing opportunities around crypto - but this is equivalent to buying a business that is selling the shovels in the gold rush not investing in gold miners/gold.",

When the devices arrived, I carefully inspected the seals and packaging for any signs of tampering. (Pro tip: Watch unboxing videos, especially for the 2024 models, as the new ones don\u2019t have engravings on the back anymore.)\n\n**Download Trezor Suite:**\u00a0I only downloaded it from the official website to avoid phishing or fake software.\n\n**Practice Wallet:**\u00a0Before setting up my main wallet, I created a \"practice wallet\" to explore the app and familiarize myself with the features. Once I was comfortable, I\u00a0**factory reset**\u00a0both devices to ensure they were clean. (same with the 2nd spared device)\n\nAfter debating for a while, I decided to use the\u00a0**Shamir Backup**\u00a0(multishare) feature. Here's how I set it up:\n\nCreated\u00a0**6 shares**, requiring\u00a0**3 shares to recover the wallet (60 words).**\u00a0Distributed the shares as follows:\n\n**1st share (40 words)**\u00a0at home. (in metal plate)\n\n**2nd share (40 words)**\u00a0with a trusted friend or family member.\n\n**3\\*\\*\\*\\*****^(rd)**\u00a0**share (40 words)**\u00a0in a bank vault, alongside my spare Trezor device, the backup seed (metal plate), and my spare Yubico 2FA key (used for securing accounts like email and Coinbase).\n\n**Heads up:**\u00a0Shamir Backup is tedious! Six shares = 120 words total (each share is 20 words), so it takes time and patience.\n\n**Using Passphrase for Extra Security**\u00a0\\- Once the wallet was set up I decided to use the passphrase (hidden wallet within the wallet) as my main wallet where I would be transferring most of my btc), my best advice, before actually starting transferring, I sent $10 worth of btc in the standard wallet and also in the passphrase wallet..\n\nBefore transferring my funds!!!!! I tested the setup by sending\u00a0**$10 worth of BTC**\u00a0to both the standard wallet and the passphrase wallet.\n\nNOTE: When creating a passphrase wallet, it can be confusing at first. If the wallet is empty, it seems like you\u2019re creating new wallets each time. Trezor will ask for the passphrase twice, which can be disorienting. This is why practicing with the initial wallet is so helpful.\n\nnow when comes to transferring your funds (this I just learned) you can't just transfer from Coinbase to your wallet freely, especially if you have a substantial amount in Coinbase, there are these AML laws that you have to be careful of, so you don't get your account flagged and frozen, at this moment am a bit paranoid about it so am still working transferring my btc"

But TA must be infinitely flawed since everyone comes up w different conclusions. It\u2019s obvious no one knows and TA is inadequate . Why because the price is determined by MMs. By ppl not charts. Big money controls approx 90% of BTC. They\u2019re not looking at some TA hobbyist\u2019s chart and then saying we\u2019d best line up the price with it. How naive. They couldn\u2019t care less and it\u2019s egocentric to think that retail has any influence on price. If they want it to be $81270 it will be within 50 pts of that amount. Get it through your heads the price is complelety manipulated. What else is there to say. Most of the movement is to disrupt and shake the BTC loose so the big money can own it. That\u2019s their goal . Ok so banks can hold BTC now. Price bounces all over and ends up same place. If you think it\u2019s a free mkt you\u2019re delusional. If you think 1 ,2, 5 or 10 coins bought or sold make a difference your delusional. If you buy it on margin then you nuts because the MMs will never let you make money on their coin. Who do you think owned the coin you bought w margin? The MMs partner owned that coin. They\u2019re not going to lose all that value while you borrow money from them to buy it. That a losing proposition for them. They\u2019re going to collect interest  and then roll the price back and take back that coin. Hey you like that Picasso. It\u2019s 500 mil. You can flip it for 600 mill next month st the Paris auction . Ok so it\u2019s 10k interest a month. Next month you sell it for 600 mil and pay us back 500m plus 10k. You make 990k. So they\u2019ll lose that extra 990k so you can get rich on their loan. Think. They\u2019ll  make  you liquidate unless you have very deep pockets. They\u2019re running a very profitable biz, not a charity. Get real."

Or do I completely not understand how the wallet works and that's exactly how it's used? I thought it was just basically physical storage. In my mind I equate that with storing gold in a safe somewhere you don't just carry your safe around and use it to buy things with gold.

You have a wallet with some bitcoin, the seller 'tells you' the address you should send to and how much to send (this is usually communicated via a qr code, but could just as easily be written down) and then you (probably) use a bitcoin app (like mycelium or any of the dozens of wallet apps) to create and broadcast the transaction. Then you usually wait for the network to confirm it. This pretty much exactly the same as sending bitcoin to/from an exchange like coinbase. \n\nThere are many point-of-sale implementations that will handle crypto transactions. And, as others have said, you might use the lightning network to help make the transaction faster and cheaper, but that's a whole other can of worms to explain.",

The QR code acts as an invoice that your wallet understands as 'send this much bitcoin to this address', you get a confirmation prompt and press send and then it's done.\n\nFor the most part, merchants still inventory things in fiat denominated values.  To issue an invoice they calculate the exchange rate at point-of-sale, in that moment in time.  Similarly a bitcoin wallet might show the bitcoin amount proposed to be sent, but also what that amount is in your local currency (you can set in the wallet).\n\nThis whole pattern seems redundant but it's just an appropriate step for now ([here's a post where I explain that more](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1h3x84o/comment/lzv6v7c/)).\n\nTo answer your original question from me personally, the first coin out of my wallet was spent buying some games on steam during the short lived window where they accepted bitcoin in 2017.  Steam issued an invoice to a 3rd party payment provider who in turn created a bitcoin invoice.  The invoice was valid for 30 minutes iirc.  Once the provider confirmed the transactions they notified steam and then the transaction was completed.  I think steam just had the payment provider pay them in fiat.  The point was I avoided credit card fees and currency conversion fees.  It was a beautiful use case.  Unfortunately at the end of the year when bitcoin went to record highs the network became congested, bitcoin network fees spiked and payments could be delayed beyond the 30 minute window which caused a bunch of complications.  At the time steam didn't have the infrastructure to cope with credits or an account balance - either the game was bought in full or the transaction failed.  So they abandoned it.\n\nThat's a moment in time when I personally came to grips with what block space scarcity meant.  These days such a system would use lightning for payments of that size."

The long and short options help offsetting the premiums and keep the cost low, and investors get downside protection by sacrificing some potential upside gains.\n\nIf you are willing to take 10% downside, then you may get up to 28-31% upside. If bitcoin explodes up 200%, you will still get 28-31% gain; conversely even if bitcoin tanks by 80% you will not lose more than 10%. \n\nThe same for the 100% downside protection for less potential gains (10%).",

Don't take it personally, and responding with hostility is not going advance the cause.  Best thing you can do is be an educator.  Patiently explain things if you think it's worth your time, otherwise better to say nothing.  Not everyone here is on the same page.\n\nAbout the only thing I would suggest is when you share something like this give a brief text summary of why you think other people should watch the full interview or what you got out of it.  The clip is a good teaser and you put the full link there.  Some people may have trouble imagining a problem that is so big and complex that it can't be explained in a tictok length video.  We actually have our work cut out just to hold people's attention long enough to see the full canvas."

It was intellectually light-weight and not worth a share, but why I mention it is because at the end of the video he does a wrap with 4 younger people, I guess to make it more relatable to the youths, idk.  Anyway, one of them gave the exact line \"it seems like a solution in search of a problem\" and I was just flabbergasted.  The only way I could interpret that is \"I've spent no time trying to understand it and I'm all out of ideas\" lol.  So bringing it back to Pysh's point, the problem itself is a really big idea.  If you start explaining what it is bitcoin is trying to do there are about a hundred side quests where people don't know foundational concepts like how the money they use every day works.  It's hard not to get distracted, it's a huge amount of data to ingest and it's about something dry and confusing yet super important.\n\nHere's a [timestamped moment in the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnhxbZlvMRQ&t=3274s) I mentioned for anybody who wants a laugh/rage."

                    "text": "From what I can figure. \n\nBitcoin is a virtual asset that has a finite amount of toekns, that can be broken down into smaller tokens, increasing the supply I think to 18 digets. \n\nHistorically speaking, banks have this problem where they can act in a way that wasn't transparent and rip people off. Either not have the assets to back up the currency printed or just straight up leave with the money. \n\nYou can make more cryto currencies and in fact, there's a lot of people who did and some have unique behaviors with the goal of trying to create a solution to a lot of problems people don't really appreciate because of how simple money can appear. \n\nFor example, right now, I have my CZLumen token. I can mint, burn, transfer ownership and renounce ownership as well as connect it to a liquidity holding wallet to basically back it up. This was the simplest crypto that makes me the authority of managing it, similar to a bank. \n\nThere's two types of \"rug pulls\"\n\n1. The owner takes whatever is gained form the token and leaves, crashing the coin. \n\n2. A wealthy investor buys and raises stock, dumps it for profit, leaves and crashes the coin. \n\nNow with any kind of token or meme coin like this, when you buy it, you're basically buying the trust of the owners which is limited to the power of the owners and those who hold assets. \n\nNow the smart thing to do is to grow it, the greedy thing to do is dump and run. Banks did this a lot in history and we see the behavior in todays stock exchange, various banks and all kinds of scams. \n\nSo we regulate, right? \n\nThis is where governing theory comes into play. How do we regulate these things so they become a public service and not a scam? \n\nOther basic options with these kinds of coins are\n\nReward for holding. This makes it so holding the coin rewards the owner, in a sense, turning everyone into faucets. This incentivizes sitting on the token. \n\nTransaction burning. This makes it so every time you spend the coin, it has a life and burns away, keeping its transactions limited and reliant on a source such as earners or minters. This, hypothetically, can help keep an economy better centralized that basically pays certain people then that money ripples out with a limited amount of effort, increasing cost for trade further away from the source. \n\nWallet transfer. This is like burning, but every trade basically sends some money back to a wallet, recycling it and potentially paying the owner or the holder. \n\nForced transfer. This treats the token like a banking account allowing the owner to seize tokens from wallets. Ideally, this lets the owner pull funds from stale, dead or criminal accounts, but that depends on the belief of the token owner. \n\nThe other thing that this helps solve is accessibility. If you have a phone, potentially you can have stock in a currency that can hold its value. The risk is that it's going to likely upset a lot of banks, institutions and anyone who benefits from the current system we have.",

It's how things change!\"\n\nIt's like, to a certain degree that may be true... if a representative gets an overwhelming number of constituents writing to them about a given issue, they may see that something is important enough to their voters to do something about it. At the very least, given enough pressure, they *may* decide to vote a certain way on a given bill. The likelihood of a letter from some random voter being enough to make a politician introduce a bill or take some other action is slim to none.\n\n99% of the time, your representative isn't even going to *read* your letter, let alone act on it. Some intern or office staffer is going to read it and draft the same cookie-cutter response and stamp the rep's signature on it. This is a prime example. Tammy Duckworth didn't read your letter or draft this response. It never made it to her desk. One of her staffers probably used ChatGPT to write this politically safe word salad and sent it on its way.",

On the other hand, if you're expecting transaction fees to climb to several hundreds of sats per vbyte, you might want to consolidate UTXOs that are smaller than 5 or 10 million sats. Recently, transactions with fees less than 2 sats per vbyte have been clearing regularly, but I can't predict how that will change in one year, five years, ten years or twenty years.\n\nYou'll also want to consider privacy. You might, for example, not want to consolidate coins you've acquired from different sources, as on-chain data would indicate that ALL coins combined in that transaction belong to you. If you have any non-KYC coins, you DEFINITELY don't want to blend them with your KYC coins.",

            "text": "With SAB 121 rescinded , I expect alot more financial products to come but do you guys have any recommendations on current lenders that are offering btc backed loans at single digit interest rates?\n\nUnchained seems to be one of the most secured but that 14% interest is pretty insane. \n\nIf you have experience with a lender, let me know what that experience was like. \n\n",

Once the market matures there will be more competitive interest rates and more laws in place to protect you from the new wave of compnaies like FTX, Celsius and blockfi."
