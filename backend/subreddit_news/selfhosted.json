Hope you guys like it.\n\n[https://github.com/Xoconoch/zotifarr](https://github.com/Xoconoch/zotifarr)\n\nBefore you lossless elitists come here to beat me up: I totally agree with you, spotify sucks and it should be erased from earth's history, but its catalog is just... unbeatable **in a noob-friendly way**. I am well aware of soulseek, torrents and  all that stuff but imagine trying to explain how to use lidarr to your mom who just switched from spotify to the navidrome server you set up last week, kind of a pain isn't it? that is the main purpose of this: to be a simple web page accessible from any web browser where your family members can search for an album (or a track) and painlessly add it to the library, no shenanigans, no rss feeds, no trackers, no piracy-nerd BS.\n\nedit: typo",

It disables the \"import\" button if I try mixing the tracks. Trying to select the album on any of the vinyl tracks still lists them as the vinyl track.\n\nSo, I tried importing just the vinyl tracks and hoping I could import the CD bonus track after, but it just set the album to the Vinyl release and marked it complete.\n\nI've edited the main entry's release to the 13 track CD again and the files are now \"unmapped\", but trying to add them has the same issue - it's automatically assuming they're for the vinyl release and I can't override the release.\n\nEdit: damn-it, there's a select dropdown at the bottom that has different operations including changing the release. Not the best UX, but it is there. Now I need to figure out why the other album didn't import.\n\nThank-you for the suggestion to get me to take a second and third look."

            "text": "Ever been watching something on Jellyfin and the subtitles are just... off? Actors are speaking but the caption text appears a second too early or too late? Or maybe you've downloaded a subtitle file that's perfect except for that annoying drift that gets worse as the movie goes on?\n\nEnter **Subsyncarr** - a Docker container that automatically fixes out-of-sync subtitles in your media library. \n\n**How it works:**\n\n- Uses speech recognition to analyze your video files\n- Automatically aligns subtitles using two different sync engines (ffsubsync and autosubsync)\n- Runs on a schedule (default: daily at midnight)\n- Creates new subtitle files (doesn't modify your originals, so it is non-destructive)\n- Zero configuration needed - just point it at your media folder\n- Deploy easily with docker-compose\n\n**Quick Start:**\n\n```yaml\nversion: \"3.8\"\nservices:\n  subsyncarr:\n    image: mrorbitman/subsyncarr:latest\n    container_name: subsyncarr\n    volumes:\n      - /path/to/your/media:/scan_dir\n    restart: unless-stopped\n```\n\nAfter a bit, Jellyfin should notice the new subtitle files are created and they'll appear as an option in your client, named with `ffsubsync` and `autosubsync` tags so that you can identify each sync engine's subtitle (for various reasons, sometimes one sync engine does a better job with the sync than the other one).\n\nLinks:\n\n- GitHub: https://github.com/johnpc/subsyncarr\n- Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/mrorbitman/subsyncarr\n\nWould love to hear your feedback and suggestions! This is one of my first public containers, built out of frustration with manually adjusting subtitles.\n\nAnd as always feel free to give it star on github if the project interests you!",

A few questions:\n\nIf it uses speech recognition to analyze the video files, how does it interface with SDH subs (no on-screen speech but the subtitle file has an entry for [wind blows]) or foreign language subs (character says something in French and the subtitle is in English)? I've watched some media where the characters are moving their mouths but you can't hear the words (due to music overlay or stylistic silence) and only *sometimes* this gets a subtitle that says <silence>.\n\nWhen it aligns a subtitle file for a video is it doing it as a solid \"Block\" or per line? Like, does it try to figure out \"how many ms to add/subtract to the file to line it up\" or does it try to do that for every single line / subtitle individually? There would be upsides and downsides for both of these approaches, but the first would be better at fixing a mismatch (you got subtitles that were tuned for a longer opening sequence, for example) while the second would be better at fixing a subtitle file with \"mistakes\" (you got subtitles where one or two lines show up early/late). If you use the second approach, how does that interact with subtitles like <silence> or (wind blows) or lyrics to music?",

I recently had a gambling website ask to sponsor BookStack but I wasn't comfortable with essentially advertising them via our website/readme sponsors list. Also what is considered ethical can be quite a personal perspective. Ironically, I feel this post's sponsor is a somewhat unethical for the [reasons in my post here](https://danb.me/blog/poisoned-source/) but I appreciate that these specific reasons are something I consider a lot more important than others, and I respect the need to be compensated for your efforts in producing this content.",

It's not possible to vet sponsors and set your \"ethical\" lines to match the priorities and expectations of all your possible readers, so I don't expect to always agree with who others may partner with. You just gotta find your own ethical line of what you're personally comfortable with."

When things don't work right the headers might not actually be passed, might not have the right value, might get mishandled by downstream servers, might not be trusted by the destination. It's good to know for sure what's leaving the reverse proxy because if that's not what it should be, all bets are off.\n\nI found this simple docker container called [whoami](https://github.com/traefik/whoami). You can deploy it and change your proxy host to point to that instead. It will display all the headers and values passed to it by the proxy.\n\nThought I would share in case I'm not the only one that doesn't know already.\n\n[whoami screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/ssxeiclzvxee1.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fcb5fb8bb3c6c9377832f0c55ba820162800ba3)\n\n",

Based on that feedback I decided to make some minor updates:\n\n* Changed the project's name from \"Zotifarr\" to \"Zotifarrr\" because this project is not a NZBDrone fork, so it is not worthy of using the sacred -arr suffix\n* Added playlists support\n* Ditched sysbox! now it is an ol' regular docker-compose install\n\nLet me clarify one thing: this **is pirating software**. I don't care how you use it, but whenever you do, remember this: the content you consume *needs* financial support to continue existing. If you consume it without providing that financial support, you are actively contributing to its potential demise. Said contribution can be more or less significant. For example, it's not the same to pirate an album by Taylor Swift as it is to pirate an album by that indie rock band that has only two releases.\n\nI started this project because I hate Big Tech and the dystopia of hyper-surveillance they advocate for. Self-hosting is part of protesting against them. That said, my words are little more than just that\u2014words, intentions I put into text in the hope that they will be heard.

I installed, it's reading the albums and says it's downloading and converting, however in download directory there are sub folders of each album, accompanied by .tmp files of the same name. No files in the subfolder. Seems like something off with conversion process maybe?\n\nCan I ask why it's necessary to convert to .ogg? converting from one lossy format to another seems like will only lose quality. Can you include an option to just keep whatever is downloaded from Spotify?\n\nI like the interface and the idea! Would be cool if you added a web player where you can stream directly from Zotifarrr.\n\n  \nOh and also to enable progressive web app features",

That's an interesting take! Thank you for sharing. I'd like to offer a counterview, though.\n\nNote that not all lawyers are attorneys, please. From what I observe in my social bubble, in-housers tend to go with self-hosted tools managed by their IT department(s). Not sure if it's their choice or IT's preference altogether.\n\nAbout the attorneys\u2026 It's a double-edged sword, isn't it? You either accept liability by self-hosting or trusting 3rd party vendors. I can see some areas of law where self-hosting is almost necessary.",

It's being managed and maintained by a professional who is (presumably) being paid for his time and experience.\n\nThose 3rd vendors will be engaging in and sticking to different types of Compliance. If Dropbox leeks your customer's private expansion and franchising plans - Dropbox has a medium sized issue that they have an entire department with countless people to work the problem. If a small private firm with a dozen people leeks those same docs - the long-term prospects for that firm go off a cliff... and maybe a blackhole at the bottom of the cliff. lol\n\nDisclaimer: I self-identify as a criminal, not a lawyer, so my information and understanding of the law may not be quite as up to date as a practicing lawyer."

This has been one of the main reasons for me to develop a homelab: to build more practical knowledge that I can then use in cases against big tech. I\u2019m much less impressed now when their lawyers try to pretend things are too complicated for authorities to understand. \n\nI guess the only thing we do self hosted is a raspberry pi SMB share attached to the printer/scanner. I\u2019d like to install Sterling PDF for automatic OCR as well but this would require better hardware. \n\nWe have briefly looked at Nextcloud because the EDPS advises this for the EU institutions.

For my use case it runs fine on a Pi5 with an external SSD attached. If I scan a lot to the ingest folder it can get a bit behind, but it catches up since I don't scan stuff all the time. A single A4 page at 600 dpi probably takes 10-20 seconds to process I would guess? Ingesting non-scanned PDFs is much quicker.\n\nSo it is possible that a Pi 5 could handle OCR for you.\n\nFor actual PDF manipulation there are also normal PC programs. A few open source ones I know of are [krop](https://github.com/arminstraub/krop) and [pdfmixtool](https://gitlab.com/scarpetta/pdfmixtool). Though my needs have been simple and I wouldn't say these are user friendly. Sterling certainly seems more advanced from the screen shots I'm finding.",

Indeed for some of them the developers recommended to disable internal auth and demanded it to a SSO service before move to production.\nYou should defend your service from brute force attacks, maybe with a fail2ban service.\nAlso ddos and enumerating attacks can bring to some stomachache, put the service behind a CDN proxy can help to reduce these issues.\nPay also attention at the reverse proxy you will choose; these  should implements https with certificate always updated and a suitable configuration (e.g. CSP and cors policies).\nAs last but not least the service must be maintained and updated: new CVE appear every day, a developer team have to fix ASAP and you have to update your deployment accordingly.\n\nAs you can see there are a lot of considerations to deal with.\nExpose a service online is not hard if you understand the implications but you have yo pay several attentions.\n\nPs.

It got me thinking: wouldn\u2019t it be awesome to have a FOSS markdown renderer that mimics Obsidian\u2019s?\n\nThe idea is to create a standalone, open-source rendering engine that others can plug into their projects. It\u2019d be a solid foundation for anyone building an Obsidian alternative or a similar app, without having to start from scratch. I tried to make it but it turned out to be pretty challenging.\n\nDoes this sound interesting? Would anyone want to collaborate on something like this?",
