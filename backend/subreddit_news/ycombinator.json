The truth is, most successful side projects aren\u2019t the result of a groundbreaking idea; they\u2019re the result of consistent execution, iteration, and learning from mistakes along the way.\n\nInstead of waiting for perfection, focus on building something small but meaningful. Start with what excites you, get feedback, and improve as you go. The project you work on now will teach you more than waiting for the ideal \u201ceureka\u201d moment.\n\nBuild first, refine later - you\u2019ll learn more from doing than from thinking about it.",

Every now and then someone who doesn't check the usual boxes does get in, that's why people keep applying even if the odds are against them. The application form's questions are useful in their own right, in making you think about what you're doing."
