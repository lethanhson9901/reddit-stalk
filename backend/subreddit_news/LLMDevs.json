But I haven't run any of this at scale.  What is the purpose of these libraries?",

If you're just using it for that, pulling in other libraries is going to be overkill.  \n\nSo I guess my question is:  Are you using these libraries for anything other than the validation of the json that comes out of an inference?\n\nAlso, just for your knowledge, chances of an error being null, and chances of an error being 0 are different.  null != 0 or None"

One thing that drew me to it was its ease of use and customizability - super helpful for experimenting with different LLM integrations. That being said, I've also heard great things about LibreChat and anythingLLM from other community members."
