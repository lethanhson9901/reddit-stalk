            "text": "The growth continues to blow my mind! Since my last update, the number of users has more than doubled to 387 active users who are now tracking 416 different subreddits. And the revenue from pro subscriptions even covered my next rent!\n\nWhat started as a simple tool for myself to find what to post and what the best posting times on Reddit are has turned into something way bigger.\n\nThe response on X has been crazy good and the tool is getting serious traction there, with users spreading the word way beyond what I ever expected!\n\nGrowth has been so wild that I actually had to upgrade my server to handle the load (which is a pretty awesome problem to have lol).\n\nSeeing people actually use and love something I built feels unreal.\n\nMassive thanks to all the early believers who took a chance on the tool and helped get the word out.\n\nYour feedback and bug reports have been key in shaping this.\n\nThanks for being part of this ride.",
