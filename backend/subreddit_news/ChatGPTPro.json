Look at their YouTube profiles, and if they have a personal website, check out their terms of service for an email.\n\nOAI made it very clear--this is essentially a beta release. So obviously it's going to not be able to do the things that one expects it to be able to do upon a full release. This is just simply the nature of beta.\n\nThus, as a user giving an honest or at least compelling assessment of it, you've got to reach an extra arm out to make sure your prompt is covering its shortcomings. What I'm super interested in is seeing *just how capable this actually is*--and that's going to require a very mindful prompt that anticipates its common struggles from simple prompts, accounts for them, and actually squeezes out what this thing can do when its got guidance on all corners."

I have to do the old-school of prompt-engineering to convince it to respond with JSON.\n* **Smaller context window**: The context window is smaller than some of the best models right now. I think it should be a little bit larger\n* **Times out**: Maybe this is just OpenRouter, but I notice it timing out at a slightly higher rate than O1.\n\nWith that being said, these are nits. It's still an amazing model. I rate it 9.6/10"

I corrected it that it should have checked Google search instead and it\u2019s available there. It navigated correctly to booking, finding a service and attempting to schedule it, but it never considered to ask for a specific barber or the time.. so I had to go in and adjust before booking. \n\nFor flights it was slightly worse. At first it messed up selecting correct dates, instead of the requested 19 and 26, it selected 18 and 27? Then once it gave me two options for a flight with layovers, I asked it to do the search for nonstop fights. Since it already pre-selected additional filters, it was getting 0 flight results and instead of trying to backtrack to the reason why it\u2019s 0, it just told me that no flights were available. \n\nI think I am okay with this being a bit rusty, but I would appreciate it to be more humble and be less \u201cdefinitive\u201d when it provides its \u201cfinal\u201d responses if it\u2019s not 100% certain."

([LINK](https://www.qualitativeinhaltsanalyse.de/)) for qualitative analysis in which they also describe the use of AI for the process\n\nso far i have tried NotebookLM and ChatGPT for doing so, but the results are often lacking in the sense that both seem to get caught up in the mode of \"i am analyzing the document and will report back once i am done\" (which simply doesn't work because neither of them can actually report back on their own)\n\nnow i am looking for input of other people - have you manged to use any AI/LLM for this kind of task and could you perhaps share how you have done it?\n\n* i am aware of the ethical implications and will do my best to use proper care\n* this is only as a first or rather additional analysis of my material (using LLMs as \"assistants\" so to speak) - > i will still use MaxQDA and conduct my own analysis\n\n\n\n",

                    "text": "ChatGPT can help with qualitative analysis, but it has some challenges, particularly with context length and depth of analysis. For longer interview transcripts, it often struggles because of token limits, requiring you to split texts into smaller chunks, which can disrupt continuity. Additionally, its outputs are sometimes not comprehensive enough, missing subtle nuances or failing to connect themes across different segments. For a more specialized approach, tools like AILYZE are designed for this purpose. They allow you to upload hundreds of pages of transcripts, generate thematic analyses, and perform detailed cross-segment comparisons without these limitations."

This is a new problem for me, and it seems pretty deep too: GPT completely fails to access information in those files, and when I ask it for details or even general summary of the uploaded files' contents, it only delivers hallucinations, occasionally with a few \"actual\" correct information included. For instance one of the files is the outline of a novel I'm working on including names of characters so far, and when I ask ChatGPT 4o to give me a list of the names from that file, it simply hallucinates a number of names, but out of about 6 names that it comes up with, only one is actually from the file (it's unique enough that I know it's not hallucinated). When I push, it says the document doesn't seem to include any names...\n\nI'm feel not just frustrated, but also pretty confused as to what can be going on... Any thoughts? ",
