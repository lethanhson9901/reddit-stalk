This is the piece of code that gets called when the game finishes, and is responsible for displaying the \"game over\" screen and registering your score if you beat the high score.\n* The `=` operator reassigns the function, meaning you're changing what will happen when the `runner.prototype.gameOver` function is triggered\n* `function() {}` is an empty function. It basically says \"do nothing\", meaning that when you lose the game (~~i just lost the game~~) by colliding with a cactus or pterodactyl, nothing will happen, and the game will continue.",
