In my experience, I would say the bare minimum to get a job offer in data science is to actually know the basics (data analysis techniques, types of models, data cleaning, library ecosystem) and to have good interviewing skills. I think the latter is often underestimated. Have some prepared answers, have in mind a couple projects you can talk about in depth, prepare some interesting questions for the interviewers,  answer questions clearly and concisely, ask clarifying questions.  Interviewing skills have probably the highest ROI for aspiring data scientists.\n\nThe above will give you a shot. If you can complement that with actual relevant experience, then all the better."

This is my first official DS role, but I was in analytics for several years before. The team I joined had no real need for a data scientist, and have really been using me as a PM for reporting/partner management. I occasionally get to do data science \"projects\" but they let me decide what to analyze. Without real engagement from partners around business needs, this ends up being adhoc analyses with minimal business impact. I've been looking for a new role for over a year now but the market is terrible. I'm in the process of completing the OMSA program, so I'm not terribly rusty on stats/ML concepts, but I'm starting to feel insecure in my abilities to cut it as a DS IRL. A new hire recently joined a team within my broader org and asked me how I productionalize my code but I never have and it made me feel like an imposter. Does anyone have tips or encouragement? ",

The only way to knock of the rust on code is to code.  The only way to figure out how to productize your code is to do it.  \n\n\\* Start spending 30 minutes to an hour on linkedin.  Follow the topics you want to use.  Make 3 comments a week (thoughtful) and one post a month.  You should do this for a while.  Tech people generally will check your linkedin profile as part of the initial resume review (after it gets past HR/AI).  \n\nAnd the most important piece of advice.  Fake it until you make it.
