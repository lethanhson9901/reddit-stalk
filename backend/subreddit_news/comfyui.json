            "text": "So when using the Hunyuan video model, I often come very close to going over my vram limit. It doesn't crash, but it gets 20 times slower if I use system ram. (Like a 2 minute render becomes 40 minutes.)\n\nSo here are some things I can try to do to not go over my vram limit:\n\n* Use a portable version of Chrome or other browser. - It doesn't have any extensions installed. Less impact.\n\n* Close the browser. - it might kill your current render, but the next cued one should run if the the command prompt is still open.\n\n* Don't open large video files or browse the web while rendering. Those things use resources / need decoding, which can add to vram use. \n\nAdd your own thoughts :)",
