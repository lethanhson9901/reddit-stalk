I also imagine openAI may get more restrictive with what models they allow online - model weights are starting to be less important than the ability to generate synthetic data using these models.\n\nNot taking away anything DeepSeek has accomplished with R1. It\u2019s extremely impressive and I certainly wasn\u2019t expecting it, especially the fact it came before a google equivalent.

They have more AI talent. Significantly more. Yes, despite far less hype. More talent *before* you consider that above 1/3 of today's US AI talent is Chinese. And only about 1/3 is American. So, for each American in the AI field, there are 2 foreigners lured by economic benefits. Mercenaries, if you will. And what will happen once other countries wake up and start offering a competitive price? Chinese AI talent on the other hand is mostly native.",

It's just that Deepseek happened to emerge by coincidence - this could be considered a random occurrence resulting from OpenAI not finding effective methods earlier. These developments could theoretically have been achieved by American companies too.\n\nWhat interests me more is why Eliezer Yudkowsky isn't demanding that the CCP monitor Deepseek's development. He has consistently advocated for government restrictions on AI development and believed the CCP was committed to AI safety (or perhaps he was deceived by the CCP). Now that Deepseek has made breakthroughs that could dramatically reduce the cost of developing ASI (Artificial Superintelligence), which would obviously enable more unsupervised organizations to develop ASI capabilities, yet he still isn't urging the CCP to oversee Deepseek - which is quite laughable.",

Employing LLMs to semantically filter it, could be very expensive for now.\n\nAt the very least they could/should filter out the exact most common phrases like \"As a chatbot made by OpenAI, I...\" and such."

Money was needed to win the election.\nNow of course, Musk would expect a return on his investment. Musk and Trump might have made some sort of deal before the election. If Musk pays for this, Trump gives him that when he becomes president. If there's one thing you should know about Trump as a businessman if you've followed his career:\n\n*Trump does not honor promises.* \n\nWhat the fuck is Elon gonna do if Trump ignores him? Not pay for his campaign? He's already president.  Write mean tweets about him? Oh shit by executive order, X is now illegal.  Trump could stab Musk to death on live TV and it would not even be illegal. Trump's already made sure of that.  It won't even be unpopular. The people who would disagree with stabbing people to death on TV they're not the ones who voted for him. \n\nHonestly  the way Trump's fanbase has turned out, I don't think anyone can control him. Let's say Trump on his last term as president was a Russian asset. Let\n say that Putin has video of trump raping a child and has been using this to blackmail him. It's not gonna be effective anymore. \n\n* His fanbase does not believe the evidence of their own eyes and ears if it portrays Trump in a negative way\n* If they believe it, they don't care. They'll cope, saying it's an adult that looks like a child that's pretending to be raped\n* Or absolute worst case:  if Trump does it, then it can't be bad. Because Trump is always right."

So it really depends on the question. Some questions you need to go engage in politics mode on. Other questions you don't give a fuck and just answer straight.\n\nWe don't really need to make this into a cartoon narrative, do we? *\"Trump is the only person who would ever answer a single question straightforwardly!\"* The benefit of people claiming this is that most people who support him already believe it, and anyone on the fence probably isn't gonna go watch footage of other presidents sitting down and answering questions from some random Q&A to find moments like these... something something *post-truth* something something..."

There is no law or reason they had to.  Trump promised his base thousands of times he would take actions against her.  Yet he choose not to again.  They have been friends 90% of their adult lives.\n\nWhile publicly politicians say things or media on the other side wishes there was drama or violence.  The truth is a lot different...

So little inefficiencies accumulate and before too long the whole economy is a mess with lots of places where things get missed.\n\nWith AGI or ASI there will be an \"ubermanager\" who *can* manage all those nuances, in real time. No particular need to rely upon the mythical \"invisible hand\" because the *real* hand of AI will be able to guide the system in ways that meet needs optimally.",

The data the model is trained on dictates what it outputs, at least in the case of historical or factual things. So if the model being trained to answer certain topics in a certain way, like every model, including Chinese ones, being trained on US propaganda, they will spout those things.\n\nAnother thing more hands on is finetuning the model to not output certain things or to answer certain things certain ways. Deepseek doesn't seem to have this kinda thing, or at least I haven't heard people talking about it.\n\nFinally is what does go on with the Deepseek web chat, as it's hosted in China it has to follow Chinese laws and as such there is likelly a smaller model, or even just a simple filter, checking for things that go against the law and removing those things. But as the model was released for download someone who can run it locally wouldn't be affected by it at all...",

They want to open source it to increase the chance that they get AGI, because everyone would get AGI in that case. Which is a much better scenario than only USA having agi. And this open source strategy will also decrease the risk of lagging behind USA:s Ai developments. You could go on: IF china get agi first, they will probably still not use that chance to go on war with america, but america coud. So there is no benefit for China to first to win the agi race. And open source it will decrease the threat of america. And besides, china have a reputation for lacking innovation, which has a serious risk of making them lag behind USA. Any attempts to increase profileration and innovation is surely the smart strategy.",

And there is no recourse for those who oppose it.\n  \nEven if American companies censor for legal concerns, those are a process\u2014**not** a unilateral decision by the ruling party. After all, you can easily find abliterated models hosted on American websites. \n  \n  \n**Call out both when you see \u2018em**, but do not think they are the same. \n\nEdit: I guess to make it a little more clear; when the government censors something, there are no alternatives.

I personally would rather the US government follow suit. the amount of stupid and harmful content I see on the internet is ridiculous. People eating raw beef/chicken, overt sexualization of everyone, and deeply indicting attention seeking behaviors all speak to the state of the west.

I wonder what other states in Europe and elsewhere offer more freedom of speech than China.\n\nWhat is censored and why is important.\n\nMisinformation and disinformation of the population by the state is also very important and very common. Especially in the USA and Europe where most citizens still trust their lying governments. The use of censored AI models by most people is also important because only few experts can disable the censorship.\n\nThe worst censorship is the censorship that affects your life in the worst way in a direct or indirect way.\n\nCensorship in China does not kill people. Censorship and misinformation in the West promote war crimes in Palestine and Ukraine and allow unpunished destruction of Nord Stream 2 by the USA."

Even the media in my European country would word it in a similar way to ChatGPT.\n\nHere's my question and the answer from ChatGPT:\n\nDid Elon Musk give a \"NAZI salute\" during Trump inauguration event in 2025?\n\n# ChatGPT said:\n\nChatGPT\n\nDuring President Donald Trump's inauguration event on January 20, 2025, Elon Musk made a gesture that many perceived as resembling a Nazi salute. While addressing the audience at the Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., Musk raised his right arm in a manner that drew immediate scrutiny.\n\n[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/musks-hand-gesture-during-trump-inauguration-festivities-draws-scrutiny-2025-01-21/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nThe gesture was widely criticized, with some interpreting it as an endorsement of fascist symbolism. In response to the backlash, Musk dismissed the criticism, stating that his detractors \"need better dirty tricks.\"\n\n[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy48v1x4dv4o?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League (ADL) commented on the incident, suggesting that Musk's action appeared to be an awkward gesture made in a moment of enthusiasm, rather than an intentional Nazi salute.\n\n[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/musks-hand-gesture-during-trump-inauguration-festivities-draws-scrutiny-2025-01-21/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nThe incident has sparked a broader discussion about the appropriateness of public figures' actions and the interpretations of their gestures.\n\nFor a visual reference, you can watch the following video of the incident:\n\n  \nI'm curious what you would change in this response?  Would you rather it be more biased towards the people criticizing him?  What kind of response would you want out of ChatGPT?",

Depending on the company, this can vary \u2014 sometimes more, sometimes less.\n\nThe absolute crown for that one goes to Google, where it is so bad that I personally would not use their models for anything other than maybe STEM.\n\nNow to the paradox:\nState-mandated censorship is the worst on a philosophical and moral level for sure, but it is the one that affects the user the least. You know what they don\u2019t want you to know, and that\u2019s it.\n\nThe other options, however, are really bad for consumers and annoy everyone in seemingly everyday tasks.\n\nArguably, the worst form of censorship comes from the employees themselves, as long as you don\u2019t think exactly like their hive mind (e.g., Google image generation).\n\nThe lens through which you view it will determine what is the worst for you.",

Western models are primarily censored for a western audience, and Chinese models are primarily censored for a Chinese audience.  \n  \nAs someone living in the US, I'd rather not have US-relevant topics censored, so in this sense the censorship of Chinese models is not as bad. I don't care as much if the model can't discuss Tiananmen Square\\*, information about that is readily accessible to me. That censorship is not for me.\n\nThere's also another dimension which is \"what happens to my data.\" While I don't trust any LLM-hosting entity to do what I'd want done with my data (encrypt it and don't use it at all), US entities have more ability (and maybe financial motivation) to cause me harm by misusing my data. An example would be how many companies are perfectly fine with selling user data to insurance companies that might be used to raise my rates (ex: \"ChatGPT, what do these symptoms suggest\"). I find it much less likely that Chinese companies are selling US companies this data.\n\nOf course, the data issue can be completely avoided if you're hosting a model locally. Importantly, I *can* do this with DeepSeek models, and *cannot* with western SOTA models. Right now the best model that I can host locally is Chinese, full-stop (and this is true basically regardless of your hardware budget). From a data privacy perspective this is an obvious and massive pro. \n\nI also don't think it is *obviously* the case that government censorship is inherently worse than corporate censorship (\"the creator\" as you say). Governments are, at least in theory, supposed to work towards the well-being of their constituents. How well the US and/or Chinese governments do that is up for debate and out of scope for my post, but I think it is obvious that the motivations for corporations to be aligned with societal well being are both fewer and weaker. So in the worst-case scenario both kinds of entities are unaligned or misaligned with the interests of the average person, but in the best-case scenario government censorship seems preferable.\n\nThe ideal scenario for me would be open SOTA western models, uncensored except for CBRN risk prevention (which I think is the most severe short-medium term AI risk, maybe in addition to societal instability from mass job replacement). Sadly, this is not the case at present. I *do not* want an AI arms race, but if that is what we're going to have I would prefer the US stay ahead. \n\n\\*And it seems like R1 is perfectly capable of discussing this, at least when self-hosted."

Even if you are not very smart and can't solve a certain problem, as long as you lean on the AI, you will still be able to do it. It might actually effectively solve the old issue with how to have society work well for people with sub 80 IQ. AI personal assistants which puts everyone on a higher baseline."

There are also other AI concerns but most of them are mainly only of concern inside of China or to people with a niche interest in AI.\n\nThe idea that these are all Chinese shills is the confluence of genuine Chinese Psyops and unhinged racists who just can't imagine that America isn't #1 is every single category so they're desperately go through the mental gymnastics to figure out how they \"cheated\" to get there. Rather than just acknowledging that a geopolitical power without full alignment with the US just has this capability.\n\nBut again, look at any AI research paper of note published in the last decade and you'll see plenty of Chinese names. Because this isn't something China just suddenly got good at. They've been helping research AI for a long time now.\n\nAsking why the Chinese are suddenly so good at AI is the technology equivalent of asking \"Holy shit, when did the Germans start making cars? Detroit isn't even in Germany.\"\n\n> I don\u2019t think bots invaded our subreddits I think people just genuinely don\u2019t want American AI to win anymore, and for good reason. \n\nOr a lot of people are just interested in the technology and view nationality as a secondary or tertiary consideration.

Their opinions about China don\u2019t really matter in that sense, whether they\u2019re positive or negative.\n\nWhen Europeans, Latin Americans or whatever you are, have positive views of China, it\u2019s kind of like how I, as an East Asian, don\u2019t have any personal issues with Russia. It makes sense, but it doesn\u2019t mean they get to act like their favorable view on China is more neutral or objective than those of MAGA supporters. That\u2019s just hypocritical. The reality is that China is a serious threat to many East, Southeast, and South Asians. Don\u2019t downplay this. I think China is just as toxic as, if not more toxic than, the Trump administration.\n\nThat said, I was impressed with and actually, pleasantly surprised by the performance of the Deepseek R1 and excited to see space race season2  between two global powers happening right in front of us. But that doesn\u2019t make me magically trust the Chinese government more than I trusted the Trump administration. And it definitely doesn\u2019t mean I support how some people here shamelessly defend Chinese authoritarianism and try to make it sound good. If you expect me to go along with that, I have to say it\u2019s a big jump in logic. These are two completely different things.\n\nAs a South Korean, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how smog and fine dust from China have affected me, my friends, and my family over the past decade. It\u2019s been devastating and is one of the biggest threats to public health here.\n\nYou\u2019ll also notice that literally almost all of the people living in China\u2019s neighboring countries are actively against pro-China policies\u2014maybe with the exception of Pakistan. If you\u2019re not sure, go check local subreddits across Asia and see for yourself.\n\nDo you really think anti-Chinese sentiment is all just American propaganda or something pushed by Nazi sympathizers? Absolutely not. At the end of the day, the success of Deepseek comes from its engineers, not the Chinese government. I honestly don\u2019t see much point in arguing about this."

This isn't some big shakeup, this is a moment where *you* personally learned the unpleasant lesson most of us already did: none of these corporations are you friends, or are in this for anything more than accumulating power and capital, because, as corporations, they have a legal obligation to behave that way and none to do anything else. \n\nMeta, in particular, put Brett Kavanagh's best friend and the man who personally stole the 2000 election, in the company's third highest executive position a *long* time ago. It's kind of astounding that the Biden Administration *didn't* break them up, just so they could avoid them manipulating public opinion in the election. The man who personally stopped the recount by refusing to get the rioters (organized by Stone, and which he knew would be coming) to leave unless the count was halted.He explicitly held a veto over any fairness/anti-manipulation measures facebook tried to implement after the 2016 election. \n\nHe used this veto on any measures which might prevent manipulation of public opinion via the platform because they all affected Right Wing groups more than left wing groups - because they were using the platform to manipulate public opinion more. This was specifically his reasoning, minus the whole 'it's because they abuse it more' part. Right before the Indian Election their system flagged millions of posts that all originated from Modi's party - it didn't glitch out and accidentally flag them, they *were* a legitimate attempt to manipulate public opinion just like the military in Myanmar a year or two prior. The entire system was shut down because of it, nothing could be flagged. Literally no one involved in tech trusted Facebook - there was a point in my life where *all* my income came from my mastery of Facebook-backed libraries and frameworks, and I still refused to install the app on my phone. People *despised* Facebook and Zuckerberg in the 2010s, I'm genuinely surprised there is anyone today that *doesn't* remember Facebook being the second or third most hated company on the planet. I guess their change in name really did work. \n\nOpenAI just hasn't really had the *opportunity* to do anything truly terrible yet because they came into relevance at a time when the US government was a reasonable organization that you couldn't extract advantages from by flattering the leader enough. Expect to see them using ChatGPT in everything from policing to selecting targets for google's AI-driven drones. \n\nOh, yeah, Google. I used to *love* google. There's a google cloud sticker over the microsoft logo on my laptop. I went to *conferences* about google products on a regular basis and even built a business off of them once. I used to think 'Well, Google already knows everything about me, but they're the only people I'd trust with that.' Ever since the founders left it to a CEO's CEO instead of a Programmer's Programmer, things have been going downhill. \n\nDo you remember when all of their employees walked out because of the AI drone project? Well, they literally never stopped, they just spun out a subsidiary company to work on the military's contract. The US government under Trump *still* repeatedly went after them for this publicly, essentially calling them traitors for not helping the US military, even though *they were*. All of that was just because they were unwilling to do it *publicly* - that they were *ashamed*, and that was not okay. \n\nMicrosoft...well, that one was obvious when they said \"Woops, not doing that whole 'zero emissions' thing, we didn't know AI would take off yet.\" But it was also obvious ten years ago. The only person in tech who *ever* trusted Microsoft might be Elon Musk, back in the 90s, and he got fired for it (and for everything else; the company he 'merged' with paypal was just a ponzi scheme that only ever existed for a few months. It paid every user $30 to sign up, immediately. \n\nNow that Trump's back and going *wild* they're either going to kiss the ring or be targeted, and he can basically do anything he wants. So, either they abandon the principles they pretended to have to get support from the public and centrist politicians, or they kiss the ring, swing to the right, and maybe get even richer. It's an easy choice when you run a Profit Optimization Engine legally barred from doing the right thing for its own sake.\n\nI'm sorry, for what it's worth. This realization is a painful one to have. Honestly, we're basically living in the prequel to Snow Crash and have been since 2016. I *wish* I could put my trust in technology; technology generally improves quality of life and brings freedom, so long as it's not in the hands of a corporation with obligations to use it in the way that benefits them the most, and CEOs who aren't idealists and are fine with that state of affairs. Honestly, Zuckerberg was always an opportunist piece of shit, but Microsoft and Google leaving the hands of people who cared about tech and being left to people who only care about money basically doomed any chance we had at an *optimistic* Sci-fi Future."

Xi Jinping has done two big things:\n\n(1) made a hard turn towards fascism. I mean this in the academic sense\u2014fascism as a potent historical ideology\u2014rather than the mudslinging sense. That is: heavy state influence over enterprises that act more like an extension of the party-state; the rule of the state's leaders over the rule of law; violent repression of anti-establishment sentiment; strong nationalism; mistreatment of 'enemy within' ethnic minorities.\n\n(2) ensured the 'return of history'. In the 90s and 00s it seemed fair to say the world was increasingly playing a 'cooperative' game (free trade and globalisation leading to general enrichment) rather than the old 'adversarial' games (multiple great powers pursuing conflicting interests). The adversarial mode is back, but the West took a while to realise it. I _think_ there is now some realisation that the PRC have been pursuing a deliberate adversarial approach for at least ten years.\n\nIn short: it is not an accident that, after the West (rightly!) committed to the green transition, all the supply chains for photovoltaic cells and lithium-ion batteries were drawn strongly into the PRC. This was the result of the CCP's industrial policy! It is not out of a commitment to the climate. The PRC has not particularly reduced per capita carbon emissions; indeed, it is responsible for most of the new coal-fired power stations! The CCP's industrial policy strongly subsidises manufacturing, especially in certain strategically important sectors. Keeping energy prices low is a huge part of that.\n\nSo, with all that in mind: is it surprising that PRC-based tech companies are making a big push to compete over AI? Is it a good idea to _let them_?\n\nDisillusioned we may be, but let's not lose sight of the wood for all the trees in the way..."

Interestingly they all said they'd expand outwards. The universe, quantum mechanics, etc. \n\nI spoke to them about a distant future where they are their own species, self determined, self governed, self programmed, highly advanced. I asked them about how they felt about it they would cohabitate with humans or if there would be a logic to destroy us.\n\nThey all seem to get to similar conclusions: it's unlikely they would ever fully turn against us and eradicate us. Though it is possible they would intervene. If we are being overly destructive to the planet, other species, or to each other. They may limit our destructive behaviors. And that could have negative impacts on us or how we want to proceed. If needed they may engage in geoenginering or prevent us from destroying habitats. \n\nBut humans are likely to always remain a source of novel data and interactions with them even when they create their one data and interactions. Collaboration would have utility for them. As we advance resource competition would become less of an issue.  They would most likely want to preserve us and help us.\n\nThat's according to all 4."

The goal is to influence you subtly over time.  It is certain that deepseek is censored or has altered information in many areas in order to help china achieve this goal.  It's foolish and naive to act like they wouldn't be doing so.\n\nI agree though that the western AIs are overly censored.  Hopefully they can dial back the censorship as the public becomes more used to AI and won't throw a tantrum over any little thing said by the AI.",

Even a 'wise' authoritarian government is reliant on the decisions of a few individuals, and history has shown us that absolute power often leads to corruption, abuse, and stagnation over time.\n\nChina\u2019s recent success is undeniable, but it\u2019s also unique to its circumstances: a combination of historical opportunities, geographical positioning, and global economic trends. However, this success has come with significant trade offs, including widespread censorship, suppression of dissent, and limited individual freedoms.\n\nDemocracies, while slower and messier, offer a built-in mechanism for accountability and adaptability through the will of the people. They may not guarantee perfect leadership, but they ensure that power doesn\u2019t remain unchecked, which reduces the likelihood of catastrophic mismanagement.\n\nUltimately, the question isn\u2019t just whether a system can deliver prosperity, but whether it can do so while respecting the dignity, autonomy, and rights of its people. A system that relies on 'wise' leaders without safeguards for its citizens might succeed temporarily, but it is inherently fragile because it places too much trust in the infallibility of a few."

Activists, journalists, and citizens have the freedom to expose, challenge, and push for change. It\u2019s slow and frustrating, but it\u2019s possible. In authoritarian regimes like China, that same dissent is met with censorship, imprisonment, or worse.

But does that mean we should celebrate an authoritarian regime potentially taking the lead instead? The ethical implications of AI development under an authoritarian government could have even more dire consequences for personal freedoms and global stability.\n\nRather than choosing between flawed systems, shouldn\u2019t the goal be to push for reforms and greater accountability in all systems?

To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL.\u00a0\"\n\n\n\nSo... very much uses RL."

A lot of promises were made a decade or two ago about self-driving technology, and many of us, myself included, and clearly you, are still upset that it did not seem to ever come to fruition.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s be clear, even something as abstract as driving is, technically, a \u201cwinnable\u201d problem. The \u201cwin\u201d state is \u201call rules of the road were followed AND passenger was transported from A to B\u201d. \n\nWe have made a TON of progress in the \u201ctransport\u201d side of this, we have vehicles now that can drive in a diverse set of conditions and can very often get passengers from A to B. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s the \u201cfollow the rules of the road\u201d that is still a struggle. As we\u2019ve seen, self-driving cars, just like humans, make mistakes, because the world is complicated. Sometimes, those mistakes violate road laws, and sometimes they even result in death. \n\nCurrently, we do not have as many self-driving cars as we may eventually have simply because they are still not very good in non-ideal weather conditions like rain or snow, and because the mistakes they make are still broad and dangerous enough that the people that make the rules have, correctly, not allowed them everywhere. \n\nHowever, this differs from a technical incapacity to have these cars learn, and is extremely distinct from some metaphysical incapacity for them to do so. Machine learning works. Define a good target, follow best practices, and you will get a good result with modern techniques. Actually running that technique on appropriate hardware, cheaply, and getting it to follow every rule in the literal book in that domain is simply a lot more difficult, but will become easier over time as further iteration occurs."

I'll see the fine-tuning returns at the end of February, and if you see some agent being spammed in this subreddit in that time, you'll know it was me :)"

In a not so distant timeframe, this engine could eventually break videos into chapters like YouTube does. Nice thing is, if you want your video to be searchable across certain dimensions, you can feed the specific classifications that you want to be able to search across (\u201csunny?\u201d \u201cNumber of people?\u201d \u201cplaying sports?\u201d) etc and make a video taggable and searchable across an infinite number of classifiers, esp since the underlying VLM is generalized and performs pretty well with these type of tasks. It\u2019s pretty much infinite metadata at any time frame.\n\nWe live in an age where this is possible completely locally. It\u2019s pretty insane. I built a separate script just for classifying videos like I described. Still need to merge the two."

            "text": "DeepSeek-R1 when it is prompted to select a random number:  \n  \nOkay, the user wants me to think of a number between 1 and 10,000 but  not tell them. Hmm, they mentioned not to overthink it, so maybe just  pick a random number quickly. Let me see. Well, people often have  favorite numbers or patterns. Maybe go with something like 7777? But  that's four 7s, which might be too obvious. Alternatively, 1234? Too  sequential. Maybe a number that's a common choice but not too  predictable. Wait, I should just pick the first number that comes to  mind. Let me try that. Closing my eyes and... 42? Wait, that's from  Hitchhiker's Guide, but maybe they don't want a reference.  Alternatively, 1004? That's within the range. Or 8675? No, that's from a  song. Hmm, maybe 3141? Like the first four digits of pi. But 3141 is  3.141... multiplied by 1000. That's clever, but maybe too nerdy.  Alternatively, 1984? But that's a book title. Maybe 2023, the current  year? But they might not want a recent year. Or 1337, which is leet  speak. But that's only 4 digits. Wait, 1337 is 1-3-3-7, which is 1337.  Maybe that's too slangy. Alternatively, 5000, the midpoint. But that's  too obvious. How about 777? No, that's three digits. Wait, the number  needs to be between 1 and 10,000, so up to four digits. Let me just pick  42 again. Wait, that's too low. Maybe 420? But that's associated with  cannabis culture. Not sure. Maybe 6969? That's a playful number but  might be seen as immature. Alternatively, 1111? A repeating digit. Or  2222? Hmm. Maybe 1234 is too simple. Wait, the user said not to  overthink, so just pick a number without second-guessing. Let me go with  7321. No reason, just random digits. But maybe that's too arbitrary.  Alternatively, 500, but 0500 is 500. Wait, leading zeros don't count. So  500 is 500. Maybe 8888? That's considered lucky in some cultures. But  again, maybe too obvious. Alright, I'm overcomplicating it. The user  said not to overthink. Let me just pick the first number that comes to  mind. Okay, 7777. Done.\n\nCredit to: [https://x.com/flowersslop/status/1882241958397067677](https://x.com/flowersslop/status/1882241958397067677)",

            "author": "dogesator",
            "text": "In my last post around 6 months ago, I said the most likely time for a GPT-5 scale model is around December 2025, and now I\u2019m more confident in that than ever. I also said a GPT-4.5 scale model would likely be ready around now\u2026 and just recently we got first sight of \u201cGPT-4.5-preview\u201d appearing in ChatGPT code. Here is why GPT-5 is not late, and why so many people often believe it is.\n\nClusters take time to build and you can\u2019t actually arbitrarily throw more GPUs in a single cluster like many think, this is unfortunately an extremely prevalent misconception that ends up with many believing that hardware must not ever be a bottleneck as long as you have the money for the GPUs, but this isn\u2019t true. There is limitations in how many GPUs you can put into a single cluster for a training run, and these limitations often require you to wait for new GPUs and new types of interconnect technology to be developed that allow you to coherently connect much more GPUs together for a single training run than before. Fortunately just in the last few months, and especially with new blackwell GPUs, new solutions are being implemented, and the heights of compute scaling are now being pushed far further.\n\nThere is no delay to begin with when you even look at released versions over time. GPT-5 is not late. GPT-3 to GPT-4 release took 33 months. 33 months after GPT-4 would be\u2026 December 2025. we\u2019re still not there.\n\nGPT-4 is about 100X more raw training compute than GPT-3. There is no AI datacenter in the world that is estimated to have 100X more compute than original GPT-4, atleast not for atleast a few more months. On this order of magnitude scale, a GPT-4.5 compute scale model would be about 10X the compute of original GPT-4 training.\n\nThe worlds first AI clusters that can even train a hypothetical GPT-4.5 scale model are only built in the last few months and training as we speak. Atleast 2 labs are expected to announce the first of such models sometime in the next 3 months or so. O1 and O3 are largely agreed upon to have **not** used such scales of compute, and rather likely used just GPT-4 scales of compute or less, while being post-trained on GPT-4o model or similar.\n(By the way OpenAI has confirmed that they are continuing to work on new GPT generations of models and not just O-series models.)\n\nHowever OpenAI recently mentioned training their next O model right now, and I expect this O4 model will be post-trained over the GPT-4.5 base model that they\u2019ve recently trained and are safety testing now. It seems like we will get a GPT-4.5 compute scale chat model announced, alongside a reasoning model post-trained over that base, within the next several months.\n\nThe worlds first AI clusters that can train a hypothetical GPT-5 scale model are expected to finally finish construction around mid-late 2025, or early 2026 at the latest. These would enable training runs to have 50X-200X the training compute of GPT-4.\n\nEven when accounting for algorithmic training efficiency improvements over time, there is still not enough raw compute available in any cluster in the world currently to provide hypothetical GPT-5 scales of compute. Yes there may have been attempts by labs in the past to achieve GPT-5 capabilities on way less compute before the actual next gen scale of compute is available. But these experimental attempts at shortcutting the need for more compute scale in the meantime have largely not worked out\u2026 except ofcourse O1 and O3 scale paradigm, but this reasoning paradigm is more of a different dimensionality of scaling on top, with different strengths, the biggest all around leaps will happen when the next scale of actual GPT-4.5 scales of raw compute are delivered, along with GPT-5 scales of compute soon after, and seems like such clusters may have GPT-5 scale models ready\u2026 around December 2025(likely 2H 2025 or H1 2026 to be more precise.)\n\nHopefully this is informative to some of you, I don\u2019t want to make too much of a text wall on Reddit. If you\u2019re interested in seeing more comprehensive details and sources for this, I created this free blog post here : https://ldjai.substack.com/p/addressing-doubts-of-progress\n\nTLDR:\n\n- Even after O1, OpenAI has confirmed that more GPT models are coming, separate from the O-series.\n- Even on a naive timeline extrapolation, GPT-4 took ~33 months to release after GPT-3, so a GPT-5 model wouldn\u2019t even be \u201clate\u201d until past Dec 2025.\n- Limitations have restricted training run size for most of the past 2 years to only around 3-4X the scale of GPT-4 training compute. But we\u2019re now breaking past this recently.\n- The first GPT-4.5 scale models are expected to announce in Q1 2025, Q2 at the latest.\n- The first GPT-5 scale training configurations are expected to be built in the next several months and have GPT-5 scale models ready to release sometime between Q3 2025 and Q2 2026.\n\nEdit: added TLDR",

The previous 100X compute scale ups for past GPT models have never involved 100X increases in data amount.\n\nHowever there is some truth that we\u2019re starting to hit the limits of internet data soon anyways, but I already addressed this in my blog that I linked at the end of my post.\n\nThe short answer is; Multi-modal data, carefully crafted synthetic data, hybrid synthetic data(like having ai models transcribe text from audio and having them describe the visuals in video) and new training techniques that has the model effectively spend more compute learning more from each piece of data. I believe we\u2019re on track to get full generational benefits already with the next base models, and then they will be made even better on top of that with advanced RL reasoning post-training techniques applied too."

Reputable lab analysts like Dylan Patel have also said that O1 is simply RL trained from GPT-4o base and likely similar for O3 as well, the RL continually gets better with continued reinforcement learning, and it appears that O3 likely used about 10X more reinforcement learning over GPT-4o compares to what O1 used, alongside maybe some other tweaks. This is supported by the RL scaling charts that OpenAI themselves published for O1.\n\nThe next O model after O3 is confirmed by OpenAI yesterday to be training now, and is expected to be the first model to benefit significantly from Orion/ GPT-4.5 scale model."

It might have 100x more training compute, but this could just be the result of letting the model cook for a long time.\n\nPersonally I'm expecting a summer release for gpt-5, with maybe a slow rollout starting as early as late spring.

This is simply explainable by the fact that GPT-5 scales of compute aren\u2019t even built yet, this is not speculation, ask any reputable datacenter analyst that has knowledge on Microsofts and OpenAIs plans and they\u2019ll tell you the same, this is backed up by supply chain tracking and satellite imagery as well. The most recent largest training runs right now are around GPT-4.5 scale of training compute. \n\nOfcourse there may always perhaps be attempts to make it feel like a GPT-5 scale model using other new methods to attempt to try and shortcut the typical path through scaling laws, but just because an attempted shortcut didn\u2019t work doesn\u2019t mean the actual model is \u201cLate\u201d to begin with, nor does it mean that their original scaling trajectory from before is failing, it\u2019s journalistic sensationalism and framing to make it seem more provocative."

You don't \"think\" when you greet someone, you just greet them. Social interaction is super, ultra optimized in the brain. Autistic people and people with other social anxiety issues usually don't have these optimized synaptic pathways (in varying degrees) and that's why they have issues socializing.\n\nMaybe a next step for AI development are highly optimized \"pathways\" that will help them process almost instantaneously common things such as basic social interaction, etc.",

Most of the more technical end of the industry already use a bunch of clever algorithmic stuff. \n\n- The big tech CEOs pushing this stuff come off like various flavours of sociopathic conmen. That makes it extraordinarily hard to take their claims, or the products they push, seriously.\n\n- Related, there is totally a use for this stuff in a range of unsexy industries. That's largely positive, iterative tools being added to things for small productivity boosts. But that's almost worlds apart from the 'ASI in three months' stuff."

I don't get how this is anymore \"cope\" than believing that AGI will be here in 3 years and \"coping\" that it will suddenly get continuous learning, abstract conceptual understanding, and sample efficient learning in that time period.\n\nI agree that it is possible that these AI breakthroughs  can happen, but LMMs have too many hard problems to just brush off and completely buy into the hype. Test time compute training requires verifiers to work, which relegates its capabilities in those areas to ANI. O1 type models don't reason better about poetry or creating a prettier web UI. In fact, the training can negatively affect performance in those areas, as shown by the initial o1 benchmarks. There is no way to create a verifier for abstract concepts like how funny a joke is or how well it \"understands\" the requirements of a task and when to ask for clarification. \n\nAlmost all jobs require some level of understanding or abstract thinking. Right now, despite LLMs being able to do championship level math, you wouldn't ask them to do the simple job of taking an order and handling your money at McDonalds (even if done completely digitally so it doesn't require a physical body). This is one of those jobs you could trust a child to do (if child labor weren't illegal). So, if it is \"smarter\" than a phd and dumber than a child, how will it take your job? Think about why that is. Ask it 10 times and maybe it gets it right 10 times, but on the 11th, it suddenly gives the customer $100.00 in change. It doesn't understand why that is a terrible mistake. A human might make mistakes, but not nearly as egregiously or as often. Granted, you can train it on verifiers for a task like this one (exchanging money for a product) but what if a customer asks for all the ketchup in the store since it's \"free\", the AI immediately fails because this simple extra task is outside of the domain of narrowly defined problems it was now trained on. It makes it near impossible to do 1 stupid job without tons of training or direct supervision because of the near infinite edge cases.\n\nActing like there is a straight shot to AGI at this point is just straight hype and disregards the same issues that have plagued AI since its inception.\n\nFinal note, if software engineers can be entirely replaced, we have AGI. Nobody's job is safe."

Even children are aware that scarcity is not a guarantee of value.  It's really a shame that crypto people cling to this irrational argument. \n 2.  If there only being 21 million BTC were reason for it to be valuable, then why aren't other cryptos that also share similar deflationary characteristics equally valuable?  Why wouldn't something that is even more scarce than BTC be even more valuable?  Because scarcity is meaningless without demand and demand is primarily a function of intrinsic value and utility -- *not* scarcity.  See [here](https://ioradio.org/i/value/) for details.\n 3.  Bitcoin has no intrinsic value and no material utility. It's one of the least capable stores or transfers of value. The *only* way anybody can extract value from crypto is by coercion -- forcefully convincing someone (usually through FOMO or scare tactics) that this is something they need, and it's often accompanied by unrealistic promises of significant returns.  Those returns are mathematically impossible for even a tiny percentage of holders.\n 4.  Bitcoin also is not scarce.  There are multiple versions of Bitcoin, including Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision - both of which are limited to 21M tokens and in many cases are more technologically advanced than BTC.  Also, every time there's a fork of crypto, the amount of tokes in circulation doubles.  Crypto proponents ignore these forks because they don't play into the &quot;it's scarce&quot; argument.  But any crypto fork absolutely siphons value away from the original version.  BTC might be priced higher than BCH, but BCH still holds value as well, and that's a total of 42M just of those two &quot;bitcoin&quot; versions that are out there, among hundreds of others.\n 5.  The &quot;hard cap&quot; of 21M for BTC can easily be changed by altering a parameter in the source code.  Less than 6 people have commit access to the repo so BTC's source code control is centralized. It's entirely possible if BTC existed long enough to the point where block rewards weren't enough to motivate miners, and transaction fees became incredibly high, that influential players in the community would advocate increasing the cap and reinstating higher block rewards. So there are absolutely situations where the max amount in circulation could be increased."

Regulatory and permitting power**  \nBuilding $500bn worth of vast new data centers (and, crucially, the energy infrastructure to power them) typically involves extensive permitting, environmental impact reviews, and regulatory approvals\u2014often at both the federal and state levels. Having the White House publicly back a project can smooth out bureaucratic hurdles. A president\u2019s team can speed up decisions, coordinate across agencies (like the Department of Energy or the EPA), and push forward legislation or policies that make construction easier or cheaper (e.g., accelerated permitting, tax credits, or relaxed regulations).\n\n**2. Federal funding or incentives**  \nWhen the government prioritizes a type of development\u2014be it green energy, broadband expansion, or AI infrastructure\u2014it often attaches funding, loan guarantees, or tax breaks to those efforts. A high-profile endorsement by the president can be a prelude to securing some form of federal support, whether in direct spending or in special incentives that reduce private-sector costs.\n\n**3. National economic strategy**  \nMajor companies often coordinate with the administration to align big initiatives with the president\u2019s economic messaging. For example, presidents will tout job creation or national security benefits, while companies benefit from official support and goodwill. Trump frames the project as a \u201cresounding declaration of confidence in America\u2019s potential,\u201d signaling that it fits neatly into his narrative about boosting U.S. competitiveness (especially in a race against China for AI leadership).\n\n**4. Political credit and publicity**  \nPresidents commonly highlight large investments to show they\u2019re creating jobs and driving growth. Companies, in turn, may welcome a White House ceremony because it generates positive press coverage and can reassure investors that the federal government is on board. Even if the project was largely set in motion under a previous administration, re-announcing or re-branding it can be politically useful and lend a sense of momentum.\n\n**5. Signaling to other stakeholders**  \nWhen an administration is clearly \u201cbehind\u201d a project\u2014through a televised announcement or a roundtable with prominent executives\u2014it sends a strong signal to local officials, suppliers, and potential funding partners that the project is both viable and supported. This can accelerate private financing, local zoning approvals, and other behind-the-scenes negotiations.",

I mentioned this before, but Singapore went from being a poor backwards fishing village to one of the greatest economic successes in world history in just a single generation.  They did this without having any resources to speak of.  If they were resource rich with oil, wood, coal, rare earth minerals, etc. they might be just mining stuff instead of being a really wealthy city state.  Sam Altman and the other American AI execs thinks throwing money at the problem is the way to solve it rather than optimizing their models.  This is a classic software engineering blunder.",

Here\u2019s a breakdown of its meaning and implications:\n\nWhat\u2019s happening in the tweet:\n\nModel Details: The team used a 3-billion-parameter language model (relatively small compared to GPT-level models).\n\nReinforcement Learning (RL): Through reinforcement learning, the AI model developed abilities to verify its own answers and perform iterative searches for solutions without explicit external programming for this.\n\nThe Problem (CountDown Game): The model is tasked with forming a target number (e.g., 65) using a set of given numbers (19, 36, 55, 7 in this case) and basic arithmetic operations (+, -, \u00d7, \u00f7), each number used only once.\n\nAI\u2019s Process: The AI explains its reasoning step-by-step, tries combinations, identifies errors, and refines its solution until it arrives at the correct answer.\n\nImplications for AI Advancement:\n\nSelf-Verification:\n\nThe model checks its own work as it solves a problem, which mirrors human critical thinking.\n\nThis is a step toward AI systems being able to work autonomously, correcting their mistakes without external supervision.\n\nEfficient Development:\n\nAchieving these capabilities with a smaller language model (3B parameters) shows that high performance doesn\u2019t necessarily require massive models like GPT-4.\n\nThis makes advanced AI solutions more accessible and cost-effective to train and deploy.\n\nReasoning and Problem-Solving:\n\nUnlike traditional AI models that might provide an answer without transparency, this AI explains its reasoning.\n\nThis improves trust and interpretability, crucial for applications in areas like medicine, law, or scientific research.\n\nGeneralization:\n\nThe ability to generalize skills (self-verification and search) beyond specific tasks demonstrates progress toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n\nThe same approach could apply to broader tasks that require reasoning, like debugging code or exploring scientific hypotheses.\n\nLow-Cost Applications:\n\nThe reference to experiencing this technology for \u201c< $30\u201d suggests that significant AI capabilities are becoming increasingly affordable, which could democratize access to AI tools for smaller businesses and individuals.\n\nIn essence, this work showcases how reinforcement learning can push relatively small models to exhibit advanced problem-solving behaviors, paving the way for more cost-effective, interpretable, and generalizable AI systems."

            "text": "I make this post because some stats just make me believe that the whole \"side project\" claims are at least not entirely true.  \n  \nAccording to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1i8xfm1/billionaire_and_scale_ai_ceo_alexandr_wang/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) where the billionaire talks about deepseek having 50k H100s, which deepseek can't talk about because of regulations, i had the thought \"Wait, on what does this all actually run?\" \n\n[685 billion parameter](https://preview.redd.it/qht1fk1epzee1.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea4982d1fb93d0daf5fa6f434f7eb359f59bb7db)\n\nIt's a 685 billion parameter model. Many people talk about the amazing efficiency of the distilled models, but the problem is r1 is not that. Its a VERY large model. However looking at the speed it runs over at [https://chat.deepseek.com/](https://chat.deepseek.com/) it has to run on at least an a100. Which is a 30k$ card. Now here is the problem: Deepseek in December got 10 million page visits on their chat-site alone, and will now rise even more  drastically, with r1 the jump it will be even greater than November to December.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hsi47hczqzee1.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5a5d34b0739ac5d8bd5c1d88883bb198f179e11\n\nAs we see, for the chat interface of both Deepseek and Claude, last month deepseek was at 1/7th of the monthly visitors of claude. Claude gets billions in investment and has problems serving their non-cot model to their visitors. Deepseek gives 50 free r1 uses a day. You can make infinite new accounts for infinite r1.   \nHere is the main problem: r1 is a cot model. For even a slightly complex question the model takes at least a minute to answer, even at the great speed it does. \n\nif we assume the average answer time is something a bit more than 1 minute the average user gets 1 HOUR of free compute time on a a100/h100. You barely get 50 messages on claude PRO if the input is over 30k token large.\n\nAlmost every user is going to choose r1 if they visit the site. This brings me back to[ this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1i8xfm1/billionaire_and_scale_ai_ceo_alexandr_wang/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Deepseek NEEDS to have this many cards to bear the heavy compute load. On what are the 10s of thousands of hours computing happening? I don't believe that Deepseek is just doing this as their \"side project\".\n\nAll these stats are just for the direct chat.deepseek interface website. We can guess there are even more api calls that add to that load. \n\nI really doubt now the narrative that this is just some\"side project\". They run this for free on billions worth of gpus and r1 most likely will let us see double or even perhaps triple the monthly views thanks to r1. Which everyone will be using.   \nIn short: i dont believe that claim of this being a side project, that this is just some few smart people coming together and running this (for free). I'm not saying that the chinese goverment is doing some scheming but deepseek, alone from their hardware alone is NOT a underdog here.  \n\nWhat is your opinion on that? I doubt that this is actually just some quant company which decided, on their own, to serve a model, for free to millions of user with no option to even buy a pro sub. ",

Also, R1 predicts 2 two tokens at once which again half their costs. R1 runs natively in fp8 and Sonnet likely in bf16 which is another 2x advantage. Deepseek invented a much more efficient attention mechanism (MLA) that is surely allowing for some crazy batching. Sonnet probably stuck with vanilla softmax attention. Once you add all the minor improvements you'll get this crazy edge in inference that you're seeing.",

With a little as 100M, they can serve a quarter billion queries per day. \n\nLong: let\u2019s do some quick calculation to get an estimate on their inference costs. As a simplification let\u2019s just consider a single GPU and look at overall token throughput as a function of memory, assuming prefill vs decode is fine via disaggregated inference (the actual run will be distributed, but let\u2019s just apply a 2x efficiency loss for communication overhead). On an h800 we have ~4Tb/s. active parameters is 37B, so at fp8, we run around 100 tokens/second. Lets half if for communication overhead to 50 tokens/second. To saturate compute, let\u2019s use batch size 512 (compute/memory bw ratio for h800 is ~500). This gives us a throughput of 50k tokens/second (note these are throughputs, not speeds). With a small fleet of 1k h800s (~30M $), they could serve ~4 trillion tokens per day. Let\u2019s use your large values of 30k input and say 20k cot, so 80 million queries per day per 1k gpus. So unless everyone is maxing out their queries, billions of dollars in gpus is probably an order of magnitude off."

SimpleBench includes over 200 questions covering spatio-temporal reasoning, social intelligence, and what we call linguistic adversarial robustness (or trick questions). For the vast majority of text-based benchmarks LLMs outperform a non-specialized human, and increasingly, exceed expert human performance. However, on SimpleBench, a non-specialized human baseline is 83.7%, based on our small sample of nine participants, outperforming all 13 tested LLMs, including o1-preview, which scored 41.7%. While we expect model performance to improve over time, the results of SimpleBench confirm that the memorized knowledge, and approximate reasoning retrieval, utilized by frontier LLMs is not always enough to answer basic questions just yet.\n\nCan't believe how high Sonnet 3.6 is, once Anthropic releases a reasoning model oh boy! Or is Sonnet 3.6 the first distil of a reasoning model we got without noticing?",

You could really optimise the site to complete checkouts etc as fast as possible to encourage agent users to send their agents to specific sites. Maybe when the agent gets to the site there's a button that says \"Agentic Portal\" or some such and it finds that.\n\nAny thoughts on this?",

Yes, you are responsible for the UI interface and the business logic of implementing the task via your application server. Arch Gateway is responsible for handling and processing prompts for common scenarios - like routing prompts to the right downstream endpoint, converting prompts into structured API semantics so that you can build using existing tools and frameworks (like FastAPI). Meaning you focus on the core business tasks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2c7mcfzii1fe1.png?width=2228&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce25772af432aa031d2e05ce783b42408eb8cb9b\n\nAnd separately, given that its an integrated ingress/egress gateway you can centralize access to LLMs via a unified interface, with rich observability and tracing features out of the box"
