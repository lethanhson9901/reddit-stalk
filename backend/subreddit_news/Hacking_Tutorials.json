I'm trying to replace the free time I use playing videogames/going out to bars/doom scrolling /watching movies etc with intense learning and feel maybe learning about computers and the art of programming could be very fulfilling.\n\nI know I need to learn as much about computers as possible, perhaps look into some courses on LinkedIn regarding A+ certs, but also wondered if hacking Sims like Bitburner, Hacknet, or even buildapc games on steam could be considered a reliable way to get into the skill.\n\nLet me know your thoughts if you have played any sim and/or reccomendations.",

Would say there are some half decent hacking games on steam but they won't teach you real world techniques. Better off going on try hack me and hack the box if you want a real taste of it . Also would be good to learn some basic computing fundamentals before hand though. A+ is a good start check out professed messers videos."

Hackthebox or tryhackme are much better bang for your buck as far as time and even money. \n\nAnother avenue is to look up BSides and see if there is one near you. Its a low-cost community driven hacker conference. That's really where it all clicked for me. Your time when you're living like that is precious, and your money needs to be spent wisely.\n\nThe other recommendation is to go to local cyber security or hacking meetups. You can usually find them on meetup.com. People just meet to geek out, but you can usually score cheap or free used lab equipment from people who have been in the field for a while. It's old and crusty hardware that isn't terribly efficient, but it's a great way to build a home lab, have a personal (and cost effective) cyber range and to learn a lot. \n\nGood luck from a rando on the internet who made it out. Stick with it, and you'll look back years from now trying to figure out how to help others doing the same thing. As always happy hacking!"
