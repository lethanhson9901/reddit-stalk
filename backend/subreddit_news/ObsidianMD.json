But this looks like a more unified way of doing things than a handful of custom scripts and a combination of Termux and Tasker. Having a more mobile friendly experience would be great as well. I don't mind opening up the command line on desktop but on mobile it's a huge drag. Local conflicts become a lot less a downside to managing syncing with git with a proper gui.  \n  \nOne thing I had to work around when I first set up my repo on my android device was my .git directory getting corrupted, which is apparently a common problem in emulated android storage. I had to separate my git working tree from the actual repository files. Does this support that or work around that problem in some way? And for automatic syncing, do you allow users to customize the git actions performed during a \"sync\" operation? For instance, I pull on app open and commit/push on close. I'm not gonna die on that hill though.\n\nDo you use some official implementation of git for android (if there even is one)?",

I'm not familiar with the emulated android storage problem you outlined here. It may be a termux git only issue. If you have any documentation or links I could look at to understand better, I can check if it affects GitSync!  \n2. Currently the auto sync and in-app \"sync now\" options do a fetch, pull, commit, push. This applies to both app open and close. It keeps it pretty simple and predictable while allowing me to add some merge conflict resolution handling. There is a bit of a debounce to prevent spam and some other \"safety\" features like an automatic rescheduling if network is lost during the sync. Feel free to open a feature request on GitHub if you do want to die on that hill :)  \n3. GitSync uses JGit, which is an Apache (I believe) reimplementation of git in Java. It's well maintained and has been around for a while. It's powered SGit and MGit too (the combo of full git clients for Android that I'm aware of)\n\nThanks for checking out the app and do let me know if you have any issues :)"

            "author": "scambl",
            "text": "I used to freeze looking at a blank page in my journal, thinking I had to chronicle lofty reflections that could pass wisdom on to future generations. Usually, this meant I could go days or weeks without writing anything.\n\nThen, I found a habit that not only took the pressure off finding something to write about, but also helped me established a consistent daily routine\u2014**I started simply writing down what I ate for each meal**.\n\n### Making Food the Focal Point\nEvery day, we make choices about what we eat, which makes it the perfect inspiration for a daily writing habit.\n\nThe most obvious is to write what we ate. You ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, so you write \"grilled cheese\" under the \"lunch\" portion of your daily note habit.\n\nBut there's so much more to it than that:\n\n- Where'd you get the grilled cheese from?\n- Did you eat a grilled cheese because it was something fast you could chow down on so you wouldn't be late to your job interview?\n- How'd it taste?\n- Did you eat it with anyone else?\n- Did you do anything to fancy it up? (anyone else add mayo to make it extra creamy?)\n\nThe habit can expand and contract based on how much time you have to write and how interesting each meal was.\n\n### Subtle Ways This Builds a Habit\n\n- **Consistency Through Routine:** Meals happen every day. By pairing writing with a guaranteed daily occurrence, there's no friction finding a \"good\" time or topic to journal.\n- **Mindful Observation:** Describing what and how I eat encourages me to notice little details. Early on I realized how much I was eating out, and changing my bad habit was easy (and kind of fun, since every new meal meant I got to write it in my journal)\n\n### What I gained\n\n- **Increased Self-Awareness:** Even brief notes on how I felt after each meal made it easy to spot unhealthy patterns (like stress-eating) or beneficial changes (like adding more protein).\n- **Reduced Decision Fatigue:** By referencing past meals and how they made me feel, I could make better choices over time\u2014leading to less stress around food selection.\n- **Gentle Entry to Broader Journaling:** As capturing my meals became second nature, I found myself naturally adding reflections on my energy levels, personal goals, or everyday insights\u2014without feeling forced.\n- **Getting out of cooking ruts:** Sometimes I'd get tired of writing about the same meal, so I'd try something new\u2014whether that's a new recipe or a new restaurant\u2014if only to have something new to write about.\n- **Time Constraints:** Entries can be as short as a line or two. The key is consistency, not length.\n\n### The Bigger Picture\n\nIt started with jotting down my meals, but I quickly learned that journaling doesn\u2019t have to be a grand production. The routine of writing my meals is both meaningful and manageable\n\nUltimately, by anchoring a simple, repetitive task (eating) to short bursts of writing, I found a natural rhythm that kept me journaling day after day. If you\u2019re struggling to start or maintain a journal, consider using your meals as a way to get into the habit!",

There are a lot of metrics but the gist is if you have a note that has a lot of similar links to another note, but it doesn't actually link directly to it, it can suggest that the two should be connected based on your structure. \n\nIt also has another metric that is particularly good that sees what notes are often closely co-present like if they're mentioned in the same sentence, same paragraph or same note and how often and then scores that potential link. So if two notes are often mentioned in the same paragraph they will be considered a stronger candidate for a link than ones that might be mentioned in the same note but on different paragraphs."

            "text": "Actually, there is no system. Just want to share this. It's of course a YMMV thing.\n\n\u00a01. Constantly remind yourself the clear reasons why you need to keep notes.\n\n\u00a0This way you will not be distracted by trivial stuff. When I started, I needed to solve two pressing issues:\n\n\u00a0(1) There are pieces of information that if I don't jot down and have a\u00a0 centralized and permanent place for them, I will forget and can't locate them when I need them.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0(2) I have ideas that I would like to be able to come back to at a later date.\n\n\u00a02. Start simple and let your note structure grow naturally.\n\n\u00a0When I decided to start a note system, I didn't make a system. I didn't lay out all the folder structure. There was no Johnny Decimal, nor PARA, and Obsidian didn't exist.\n\n\u00a0I just started to write the first note, and put it in an appropriate folder. If it's a recipe I see on the internet, I save it in the \"recipe\" folder. If it's a piece of musing about music, I put it in the \"music\" folder.\n\n\u00a0There were no other folders. Over time, your folders will grow organically to cover more or less all aspects of your life. But there is no need to have a grand design. At first I used a program with only folders. Then Evernote appeared and I replicated the structure with nested tags. Then, other apps.\n\n\u00a03. There are only 2 main requirements for my note system:\n\n\u00a0(1) When I need to retrieve a piece of information, I need to be able to find it effortlessly. I achieve this by navigating using folders, tags, or do a search. As long as the note is in the system, these three methods never fail.\n\n(2) I need to be able to review all my notes when I choose to, so nothing falls through cracks. This I can achieve by browsing my notes by folder, or by tag.\n\nReally, what more can you ask from a note system? My notes are not my \"second brain.\" I only have one brain, which does the thinking. All ideas come from that brain. My notes are aids to defeat oblivion, but they don't think for me.",
