            "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m really excited to share that **TryTelescope.io** is now live on Product Hunt!\n\nA little bit about us: for the past three years, our team has been working on making B2B prospecting easier. We saw that finding the right leads can be really hard, so we wanted to help solve that. A few months ago, we launched the first version of TryTelescope, and while we celebrated, we knew we could make it even better.\n\nNow, we\u2019ve launched **Telescope 2.0 with Smart Criteria**! This new feature lets you search for leads and companies in a much more personal way. Instead of using basic filters, you can be really specific about what you want. For example:\n\n* Want companies with 5 or more Product Managers and no one in QA? You can search for that.\n* Looking for SaaS companies making mobile apps? TryTelescope can find them.\n* Need leads with a finance degree and 10+ years of experience? We\u2019ve got you covered.\n\nWith Smart Criteria, you get exactly what you\u2019re looking for, faster. Plus, it\u2019s easy:\n\n1. Tell us who you want to find, in your own words.\n2. Look through the list of leads we give you.\n3. Add them straight to your pipeline.\n\nWe\u2019ve also added some other cool features:\n\n* **Unlimited leads for free** \u2013 You can now get as many leads as you want, without paying.\n* **Find similar companies** \u2013 Upload a list of companies, and we\u2019ll find similar ones for you.\n* **Account-based research** \u2013 Upload a list of companies you want to target, and we\u2019ll help you find the best people to contact in each one.\n\nIn a world where most outreach is automated, we still believe that having the right lead data is key to success. TryTelescope helps you do just that\u2014faster and smarter.\n\nWe\u2019d love your support! Please check it out here:[ Telescope on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/telescope-2-0-2).\n\nI\u2019m really looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",
