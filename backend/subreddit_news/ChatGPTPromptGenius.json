            "text": "[Full article taken from my Medium!](https://medium.com/p/65a5116e5eaa)\n\nI am the weirdest AI fanboy you'll ever meet.\n\nI've used every single major large language model you can think of. I have completely replaced VSCode with Cursor for my IDE. And, I've had more subscriptions to AI tools than you even knew existed.\n\nThis includes a $200/month ChatGPT Pro subscription.\n\nAnd yet, despite my love for artificial intelligence and large language models, I am the biggest skeptic when it comes to AI agents.\n\n[Pic: \"An AI Agent\" \u2014 generated by X's DALL-E](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*ZGZHRi3VSgirewnjtto9hA.png)\n\nSo today, when OpenAI announced [Operator](https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/), exclusively available to ChatGPT Pro Subscribers, I knew I had to be the first to use it.\n\nWould OpenAI prove my skepticism wrong? I had to find out.\n\n# What is Operator?\n\n[Operator](https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/) is an agent from OpenAI. Unlike most other agentic frameworks, which are designed to work with external APIs, Operator is designed to be fully autonomous with a web browser.\n\nMore specifically, Operator is powered by a new model called [Computer-Using Agent (CUA)](https://openai.com/index/computer-using-agent/). It uses a combination of different models, including GPT-4o for vision to interact with graphical user interfaces.\n\nIn practice, what this means is that you give it a goal, and on the Operator website, Operator will search the web to accomplish that goal for you.\n\n[Pic: Operator building a list of financial influencers](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*RVtoRolOygMy-TnZF_gMOA.png)\n\nAccording to the OpenAI launch page, Operator is designed to ask for help (including inputting login details when applicable), seek confirmation on important tasks, and interact with the browser with vision (screenshots) and actions (typing on a keyboard and initiating mouse clicks).\n\nSo, as soon as I gained access to Operator, I decided to give it a test run for a real-world task that any middle schooler can handle.\n\nSearching the web for influencers.\n\n# Putting Operator To a Real World Test \u2013 Gathering Data About Influencers\n\n[Pic: A screenshot of the Operator webpage and the task I asked it to complete](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ufUrEq6KKJ_d8r46NUasAQ.png)\n\n**Why Do I Need Financial Influencers?**\n\nFor some context, I am building an AI platform to automate investing strategies and financial research. One of the unique features in the pipeline is monetized copy-trading.\n\nThe idea with monetized copy trading is that select people can share their portfolios in exchange for a subscription fee. With this, both sides win \u2013 influencers can build a monetized audience more easily, and their followers can get insights from someone who is more of an expert.\n\nRight now, these influencers typically use Discord to share their signals and trades with their community. And I believe my platform can make their lives easier.\n\nSome challenges they face include:\n\n1. They have to share their portfolios everyday manually, by posting screenshots.\n2. Their followers have limited ways of verifying the influencer is trading how they claim they're trading.\n3. Moreover, the followers have a hard time using the insights from the influencer to create their own investing strategies.\n\nThus, with my platform NexusTrade, I can automate all of this for them, so that they can focus on producing content. Moreover, other features, like the ability to perform financial research or the ability to create, test, optimize, and deploy trading strategies, will likely make them even stronger investors.\n\nSo these influencers win twice: one by having a better trading platform and again for having an easier time monetizing their audience.\n\nAnd so, I decided to use Operator to help me find some influencers.\n\n**Giving Operator a Real-World Task**\n\nI went to the [Operator website](https://operator.chatgpt.com/) and told it to do the following:\n\n>\n\nOperator then opens a web browser and begins to perform the research fully autonomously with no prompting required.\n\nThe first five minutes where extremely cool. I saw how it opened a web browser and went to Bing to search for financial influencers. It went to a few different pages and started gathering information.\n\nI was shocked.\n\nBut after less than 10 minutes, the flaws started becoming apparent. I noticed how it struggled to find an online spreadsheet software to use. It tried Google Sheets and Excel, but they required signing in, and Operator didn't think to ask me if I wanted to do that.\n\nOnce it did find a suitable platform, it began hallucinating like crazy.\n\nAfter 20 minutes, I told it to give up. If it were an intern, it would've been fired on the spot.\n\nOr if I was feeling nice, I would just withdraw its return offer.\n\nJust like my initial biases suggested, we are NOT there yet with AI agents.\n\n# Where Operator went wrong\n\n[Pic: Operator looking for financial influencers](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*xaCC_cZShS2nK3r80DBdCQ.png)\n\nOperator had some good ideas. It thought to search through Bing for some popular influencers, gather the list, and put them on a spreadsheet. The ideas were fairly strong.\n\nBut the execution was severely lacking.\n\n**1. It searched Bing for influencers**\n\nWhile not necessarily a problem, I was a little surprised to see Operator search Bing for Youtubers instead of\u2026 YouTube.\n\nWith YouTube, you can go to a person's channel, and they typically have a bio. This bio includes links to their other social media profiles and their email addresses.\n\nThat is how I would've started.\n\nBut this wasn't necessarily a problem. If operator took the names in the list and searched them individually online, there would have been no issue.\n\nBut it didn't do that. Instead, it started to hallucinate.\n\n**2. It hallucinated worse than GPT-3**\n\nWith the latest language models, I've noticed that hallucinations have started becoming less and less frequent.\n\nThis is not true for Operator. It was like a schizophrenic on psilocybin.\n\nWhen a language model \"hallucinates\", it means that it makes up facts instead of searching for information or saying \"I don't know\". Hallucinations are dangerous because they often sound real when they are not.\n\nIn the case of agentic AI, the hallucinations could've had disastrous consequences if I wasn't careful.\n\n[Pic: The browser for Operator](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*hrosIrCQcwjeiNuTadfS2A.png)\n\nFor my task, I asked it to do three things:\n\n* Gather a list of 50 popular financial influencers from YouTube.\n* Get their LinkedIn information (if possible), their emails, and a short summary of what their channel is about.\n* Format the answers in a table\n\nOperator only did the third thing hallucination-free.\n\nDespite looking at over 70 influencers on three pages it visited, the end result was a spreadsheet of 18 influencers after 20 minutes.\n\nAfter that, I told it to give up.\n\nMore importantly, the LinkedIn information and emails it gave me were **entirely made up**.\n\nIt guessed contact information for these users, but did not think to verify it. I caught it because I had walked away from my computer and came back, and was impressed to see it had found so many influencers' LinkedIn profiles!\n\nIt turns out, it didn't. It just outright lied.\n\nNow, I could've told it to search the web for this information. Look at their YouTube profiles, and if they have a personal website, check out their terms of service for an email.\n\nHowever, I decided to shut it down. It was too slow.\n\n**3. It was simply too slow**\n\nFinally, I don't want to sound like an asshole for expecting an agentic, autonomous AI to do tasks quickly, but\u2026\n\nI was shocked to see how slow it was.\n\nEach button click and scroll attempt takes 1\u20132 seconds, so navigating through pages felt like swimming through molasses on a hot summer's day\n\nIt also bugged me when Operator didn't ask for help when it clearly needed to.\n\nFor example, if it asked me to sign-in to Google Sheets or Excel online, I would've done it, and we would've saved 5 minutes looking for another online spreadsheet editor.\n\nAdditionally, when watching Operator type in the influencers' information, it was like watching an arthritic half-blind grandma use a rusty typewriter.\n\nIt should've been a lot faster.\n\n# Concluding Thoughts\n\nOperator is an extremely cool demo with lots of potential as language models get smarter, cheaper, and faster.\n\nBut it's not taking your job.\n\nOperator is quite simply too slow, expensive, and error-prone. While it was very fun watching it open a browser and search the web, the reality is that I could've done what it did in 15 minutes, with fewer mistakes, and a better list of influencers.\n\nAnd my 14 year-old niece could have too.\n\nSo while a fun tool to play around with, it isn't going to accelerate your business, at least not yet. But I'm optimistic! I think this type of AI has the potential to automate a lot of repetitive boring tasks away.\n\nFor the next iteration, I expect OpenAI to make some major improvements in speed and hallucinations. Ideally, we could also have a way to securely authenticate to websites like Google Drive automatically, so that we don't have to manually do it ourselves. I think we're on the right track, but the train is still at the North Pole.\n\nSo for now, I'm going to continue what I planned on doing. I'll find the influencers myself, and thank god that my job is still safe for the next year.",

            "text": "Last week, an innovative startup from China, DeepSeek, captured the AI community's attention by releasing a groundbreaking paper and model known as R1. This model marks a significant leap forward in the field of machine reasoning.\n\nThe importance of DeepSeek's development lies in two major innovations:\n\n1. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) Algorithm: This pioneering algorithm enables AI to autonomously develop reasoning abilities through trial and error, without human-generated examples. This approach is significantly more scalable than traditional supervised learning methods.\n\n2. Efficient Two-Stage Process: DeepSeek's method combines autonomous learning with subsequent refinement using real examples. This strategy not only achieved top-tier accuracy, scoring 80% on AIME math problems but also maintained efficiency through a process known as model distillation.\n\nIn the detailed blog post below, I explain exactly how DeepSeek achieved these impressive results with R1, offering a clear and intuitive explanation of their methods and the broader implications.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions :)\n\nLink to the full blog post:\nhttps://open.substack.com/pub/diamantai/p/teaching-machines-to-reason?r=336pe4&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false",

What's truly impressive here are its technical capabilities, which rank it at or near the top on all benchmarks. That\u2019s especially remarkable for a \"free\" open-source model. Closed-source companies should be seriously concerned about their futures, this model can match their performance at 1/50th of the cost.",
