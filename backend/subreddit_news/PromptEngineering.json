            "text": "Last week, an innovative startup from China, DeepSeek, captured the AI community's attention by releasing a groundbreaking paper and model known as R1. This model marks a significant leap forward in the field of machine reasoning.\n\nThe importance of DeepSeek's development lies in two major innovations:\n\n1. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) Algorithm: This pioneering algorithm enables AI to autonomously develop reasoning abilities through trial and error, without human-generated examples. This approach is significantly more scalable than traditional supervised learning methods.\n\n2. Efficient Two-Stage Process: DeepSeek's method combines autonomous learning with subsequent refinement using real examples. This strategy not only achieved top-tier accuracy, scoring 80% on AIME math problems but also maintained efficiency through a process known as model distillation.\n\nIn the detailed blog post below, I explain exactly how DeepSeek achieved these impressive results with R1, offering a clear and intuitive explanation of their methods and the broader implications.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions :)\n\nLink to the full blog post:https://open.substack.com/pub/diamantai/p/teaching-machines-to-reason?r=336pe4&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false",
