I use it to prepare for meetings, interviews, as well as general topic learning. I grab a load of sources, provide a prompt and listen to the audio overview.

The \"interactive mode\" makes it possible to ask ad hoc questions verbally, and go deep on specific areas. \n\nThe quality of the summarisation seems higher than elsewhere. With some other AI tools I feel like a summary is all it can go - like they're unnecessarily brief - but with Notebook LM I feel like I can dig into the detail on demand. \n\nHope this helps?"

I'd like to have a good conversation with engineering to talk about different approaches for solving the problem, discuss the tradeoffs, how it can be broken down into smaller pieces, and come to a conclusion about how what we're going to do. Working together, we can put together some sketches, documentation, etc. Whatever we need to capture the solution. I've worked with some teams that don't want to understand the customer or the problems, and just want to be handed requirements. The latter results in a few things: \n\n* More detailed requirements are necessary\n* No matter how detailed the requirements, there will always be questions. If the engineering team was part of the ideation phase, they can do a better job of answering some of those questions on their own because they actually understand what's going on. They're not just a bunch of code monkeys\n* Maybe I'll come up with the best solution on my own, but probably not. The engineering team sometimes have the best ideas about how to solve problems. Working together we can do a better job most of the time\n* It takes a lot of time to put together requirements. Then I still have to have the discussion with the team about what we're doing and get feedback. But now that conversation is happening much later in the process. Maybe they uncover some technical problems that make my proposal difficult. Worst case, I have to go redo most of the requirements, and then process repeats itself. This back and forth can take months\n\n**Writing everything themselves (or nothing):** it can be difficult to get engineers who can find a good balance between writing new code versus using tools or existing code. Some want to write everything themselves. Others want to use a library for everything. Some want to refactor every piece of code they touch, others never want to\n\n**Insisting on 100% solutions:** we don't always have to cover every possible use case and write the most beautiful code in the world. It's great to start with something that's hacked together quickly and provides the bare minimum functionality. We can get that in front of a few customers and see if it's worth building something better. Again, it's a balance",

Most often what I saw working best in these cases is having a tech/team lead who is involved in the process and can guide the rest of engineering team later in the dev cycle. Often when I tried to get a team like that involved more in the process I would end up being the only one talking anyway, having to explicitly nudge others to contribute which was rarely productive\n\n>**Writing everything themselves (or nothing)**\n\nYes, that's a never ending debate among engineers themselves\n\n>**Insisting on 100% solutions**\n\nI'd say this is indeed often not reasonable. The problem sometime lies in these hacky solutions end up being a permanent solution and an ongoing headache for developers. And there should be tolerance in business to higher rate of errors/bugs that often come with hacky solutions. Often there are people throwing tantrums when things are breaking and engineering is of course held accountable",

Ambiguity being: We don't know exactly what or how to build something. Which is Product's role to get from ambiguity to (near) clarity.\n\nI try to figure out which of the engineering team are curious (a sign they see the ambiguity and aren't unsettled by it) or those that complain about the direction of the product (a sign they aren't just code monkeys and want to be invested in the direction of the product) and try to include them. \n\nAs you say, the best thing is often to work with a good tech lead and let them manage the personality types that they're better set up to work with. Which is why it's incredibly important leaders know that team/tech leads have to be collaborative and able to handle ambiguity. The worst roles I've had are where it was the tech lead who would just bark for more and more and more requirements before they would even talk to me, essentially \"solve everything, then I'll tell you how wrong you are!\" so I would then go back and rework everything including full redesign, they could then point at Product as the reason for delays. Infuriating. Venting aside...\n\nSo by finding the people in the team that can be collaborative you can also work around a tech lead that's not. \n\nIt's the same TBH with product people and designers, there's some that operate well ONLY in ambiguity, and suck at working out like functional requirements, detailing them, designing to them etc. but those people are still useful, but only in the ambiguity phase, like Devs that hate ambiguity are only useful in the delivery phase."

Idk what you're doing now, so you may be doing some of what I'm about to share already but here's some action you could take:\n\n- find an ally among that group , bring them along the process. Show them how you make decisions and how things work. I find that non prod/eng folks really have no idea how things work and therefore no empathy. Once they learn, the conversations are usually more productive. Bring in an eng to help explain if you've got any allies there \n\n- low hanging fruit. Find one thing that's a small lift technically but a big pain point for them and get it done even if it doesn't fit your roadmap. They're never going to be on your side if you don't solve any of their problems. Fixing bugs quickly doesn't have any impact because in their mind, shit should just work.\n\n- take control of the meeting. Seems like you've created a venue for them to air their grievances. That would be fine if there was a healthy relationship, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Introducing and enforcing structure will help you drive the conversation to be more productive rather than destructive. Set a clear agenda for that meeting and make sure there's no room/time for anything else.",

Pick a loud person and a quiet one and start there. Giving them one on one time and honesty goes a long way, as does taking interest in deeply understanding their problems to the point that the type of analysis above is possible. You are a partner in all of this, not just their complaint box. Once you\u2019ve turned that corner with a couple of people the tone tends to change."

Some seem more compassionate and well meaning than others, but there's a difference between trying to make them feel heard, actually listening to them, and advocating for them (if they're right).

While most of their revenue comes from businesses, a significant portion relies on users. So, what\u2019s really going on? and, what would you do to solve the problem as a PM?",

I'd TRY to redesign the algorithm to prioritize actual professional conversations and expertise sharing over \"I'm humbled to announce...\" posts. Or \"LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT WHAT I DID...\" crap.  Think more industry insights, less humble brags.\n\n**Job Search Nightmare:**  \nMan, the job section is a mess. Too many fake listings and sketchy recruiters. I'd implement stronger verification for job postings and recruiters, similar to how Airbnb vets their hosts. Plus, add a reliability score based on hiring history and candidate feedback - maybe that is getting too close to Glassdoor, but there has to be a balance here. And they should hold people and users accountable. \n\n**UX:**  \nThe UI feels cluttered and corporate. It needs to feel more natural and conversational, like how people actually network in real life. I'd simplify the UI and make it easier to have meaningful convos without feeling like you're writing a corporate press release every single time, etc. \n\nAll the shit I'd do, however, is probably wishful thinking.  LinkedIn's caught between being a professional network and a biz platform. They need to refocus on what made them special, which was making genuine professional connections.\n\nThe rev will follow if they nail that UX. \n\nJust my 2 cents as someone who's both frustrated by, and dependent on it at times. \n\n\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af",

As for the job section, I'm right there with you on your thoughts! I do wonder if it's sustainable for their business since they depend on paid ads.

There\u2019s something disheartening about wondering if the person commenting on your post actually thought through their response or if it\u2019s just an AI bot trying to seem insightful. It adds to the feeling of inauthenticity that so many people mention when they talk about LinkedIn.\n\nAs a product manager, I think this comes back to trust. Whether it\u2019s fake job listings, unreliable recruiters, or AI-generated comments, users are experiencing friction that chips away at the sense of genuine connection LinkedIn is supposed to foster. And when trust erodes, engagement suffers.\n\nIf I were tackling this problem as a PM, I\u2019d start with two things:\n\n1. Redefine what authenticity means on LinkedIn: Make it easier to identify real engagement \u2014 whether that\u2019s through transparency (e.g., labels for AI-generated responses) or highlighting posts/comments from verified users who consistently provide value. Help users feel confident that the interactions they\u2019re having are meaningful.\n2. Double down on user feedback: LinkedIn is a complex ecosystem serving multiple audiences. But if users feel ignored or like their frustrations (e.g., fake jobs, disingenuous networking) aren\u2019t being addressed, they\u2019ll disengage. A robust feedback loop \u2014 combined with clear action plans \u2014 could show users that LinkedIn is listening and evolving."

(A) Facilitate connecting individuals who **both** benefit from meeting each other, and (B) Facilitate connecting hiring managers with qualified and capable individuals looking for work.  \n\n\n**Changes**  \nFor (A): Build out functionality where a user can specify what they have to offer (and ideally some way to back it up, eg reference a past job, educational experience, certificate program, reference statement from a former manager, etc), and the type of people they are looking to meet. For instance, \"Experienced PM looking to connect with mid-level engineers interested in social media platforms for discussion and mutual learning.\". Take a page from various dating apps for the way matchmaking works, and improve the messaging and communication abilities. Create group messaging tools limited to small groups (eg, <10) and that are invite-only (eg, a member of the group has to invite you in). Prominently publish best practices on building your professional network. Create different classes of \"connections\": former colleagues, friend of a friend, social groups, growing your network, etc, so individuals can organize lists of people that now are often 500+. Allow users to store private notes about contacts - \"I met Jimmy at \\[place\\], and he loves \\[hobby\\]. His kids are \\[ages and names\\]\", and reminders (\"reach out to Jimmy in October 2025 to reconnect and learn what he's now up to\"). \n\nFor (B): When a job is posted, do two important things: (1) evaluate that role against various best practices (eg, skills-focused rather than years of experience, flag language that is likely discriminatory, etc) and (2) Immediately flag a short list of candidates who would be an excellent fit. Surface best-practice documentation during the job posting process (admittedly, I haven't posted a new job on LI for about three years, so maybe they've done this), and put a \"rating score\" on every job posting to show how well it complies with best practices. Create a dedicated communication channel (eg, not the hiring manager's personal DMs) where applicants can reach out with questions and express interest. \n\nI'm leaving a ton out, but I hate long comments. Happy to elaborate on any of this. Please don't jump to the assumption that if I haven't mentioned something, I think it shouldn't be done. I'm trying to share some high-level ideas, and would generally work with a team to pressure-test all of this."

We are essentially now just building our services in new environments and I don\u2019t really know what to do with my day other than ask Eng for updates every few days.\n\nHow do you add value when all of your work is deployment? Do you just keep working in requirements for upcoming work and let Eng handle deployment?",
