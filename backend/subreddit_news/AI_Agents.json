                    "text": "I've scanned through some of the responses on this thread and have some unsolicited advice if you are interested.   \n  \nFor the people who recommend Salesforce, as a former CTO of a company that used SalesForce for their mission-critical operations, I do not and cannot recommend Salesforce. The UX is ugly, the workflows are hard to set up, and the data is impossible to get out of the system. Salesforce also has antiquated licensing models and when they say it will cost $25 per month, once you get to scale you end up with a six-figure bill. It is VERY hard to find SKILLED talent in this space. If you decide that you do want this, I have an offshore company I worked with that I can recommend. I don't work for them but did work with them on a very complex project and they did a good job for me. This was my main contact at the company: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/harsimran-singh-11773a1a2/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harsimran-singh-11773a1a2/)\n\nMany of your requirements won't exist in existing solutions \"Seamless integration\" being one. Seamless multilanguage support another.  I haven't evaluated the products mentioned in this list but can only honestly say that I have been evaluating SaaS platforms for over 20 years and almost none of them do everything they promise and most of them are hard to get data into/out of.\n\nFor the folks who are offering custom work which you may need if you have all of these requirements, I created an RFP sheet with questions to help you find the right person and some background on why these questions are important. [https://foundersworkshop.com/blog/d5/how-to-hire-your-first-dev-team/](https://foundersworkshop.com/blog/d5/how-to-hire-your-first-dev-team/) \n\nI used to work for this company as the VP of development (left to be a CTO for one of our clients) and they have a very good technology team that is nearshore and an excellent development process for MVPs. It is very common to be told \"YES! I can build that!\" and then tens of thousands (and even sometimes hundreds of thousands) of dollars later have a non-functioning product that doesn't anything that was promised. They do give me a referral if you would sign with them. You can say I referred you or not but I like their team and feel good recommending them.   \n  \nBeware before you just pay a developer a pile of money. MVPs have a 70-90% failure rate and most software projects end up costing 2-3x more than what was promised (or more). Get multiple bids, get your requirements written down before you bid so everyone is clear on what you are paying for/receiving, and determine who is doing what (do they do QA testing or do you do it?) Once the project is done, how do you get support if you need updates/enhancements? Most shops the dev rolls off to a new project. You may/may not get that person back and will need to budget for the learning curve for the \"new guy\" who will invariably tell you the code needs to be rewritten if you need new capabilities beyond basic updates.",

                            "text": "More to add (original comment was too long):  \nAll I can say is there are very few dev companies I trust and I have been in the industry for a long time leading complex software projects of all types for many different industries. This is me (my reddit name is real) [https://www.linkedin.com/in/crystaltaggart/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/crystaltaggart/) \n\nMy recommendation on your requirements above (I'm a professional product manager) is to also include capabilities to auto-stop job openings once you get enough candidates for a position. As a person who has been job seeking, it's so frustrating to put in the effort to apply to thousands of jobs and not even have my resume considered because the hiring manager forgot to pause the job listing. Be respectful of the time of people who are looking for work. It pretty much sucks to look for a job and try to get an interview these days. You can ask the AIs (Claude is my favorite but ChatGPT is also good) on additional requirements that you could/should consider. ChatGPT may also provide a list and it has the ability to search the web for additional solutions. I've used ChatGPT to narrow down which solutions I should even evaluate based on my criteria and it (he) has been brilliant.\n\nIf you decide that you want to move forward on a custom solution, I have a video on Youtube on how to approach a software project and things to know: [https://youtu.be/eV9goYEI0ps?si=jTNAZSI5f31mne-s](https://youtu.be/eV9goYEI0ps?si=jTNAZSI5f31mne-s) \n\nGood luck in your automation quest!"

At Foresthire, I\u2019ve built tools designed specifically for high volume hiring.\n\nBuilt a human Voice AI with emotions and empathy to have conversations with your candidates. It can handle any sort of assessment, follow a script, answer candidate questions, record conversations (+video). On top of that you have access to a smart CRM where you ask additional questions and the AI prefills the answer for all candidates based on the resume + interview.\n\nWe also simplify job postings by auto-publishing roles across 15+ EU job boards and social platforms. Our system manages applicants from start to finish. Most HR systems integrate in about a day, and we take care of setup and training.\n\nFor instance, a staffing firm in Berlin uses our tools to screen over 1,200 tradespeople each month, cutting their screening time by 60%. I\u2019d be happy to share more about this or show you how it works in a quick demo.\n\nLet me know if this sounds like something worth exploring."

The goal right now is when the email comes in if it\u2019s a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, it goes into a folder for resumes and then it populate an Excel on boarding sheet, which you can then communicate withlike a chat I think it\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re looking for cause I can definitely adjust it to also communicate with the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on board labour additionally I am a cabinet maker and an architect in the residential construction industry so I know exactly the situation you might be similar to like a general contractor. I would love to give my opinion my two cents and the tools I\u2019ve built in the last year if you\u2019re interested, please message me.! \n\nHere in Canada, we\u2019re trying to commence a lot of industries to move to teams and Microsoft, which allows us to communicate with one another that isn\u2019t emails or text messages or phone calls cause in reality.

You\u2019ll match a contractor with a high salary requirement and great expertise for a role that is not completely complimentary to their skill set. Both parties will be relatively satisfied, but neither will feel it\u2019s a good fit and both will keep looking. \n\n2. You\u2019ll match a junior contractor to a senior level position. The junior, while enthusiastic and capable, spends a good deal of time referencing manuals and presentations. One mis-step in their ideation and their whole strategy breaks. Everyone loses. \n\n3. You\u2019ll match an entry level contractor with an entry level position. You won\u2019t get a hefty fee given the lower skill level. The contractor will want growth and support, the employer will want someone to get the job done. Everyone wins sort of, nobody really complains, but everyone knows that it\u2019s not ideal."

Without this knowledge, AI agents can\u2019t perform complex tasks effectively or even simple ones that require some level of familiarity with the organization. \n\nYou can't buy this training data set from the NYT or Reddit, and it comes down to humans training agents .

It was just slow and the models weren't quite robust and adaptive enough to make it a great option for a SaaS so we ended up just using the AI for the data ingestion.
