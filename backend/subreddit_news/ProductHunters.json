We saw how hard it was to find the right leads, so we wanted to help solve that problem. After launching the first version of Telescope a few months ago, we knew we could make it even better. \n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve introduced Telescope 2.0 with Smart Criteria. Now you can customize your search to find exactly the leads and companies you need\u2014no more guessing! Whether you\u2019re looking for companies with certain job roles or leads with specific skills, it\u2019s all much quicker and easier. \n\nWe\u2019ve learned so much along the way, and we\u2019re thrilled to share this with you. \n\nWe\u2019d love your support! Check it out here: [Telescope on Product Hunt. ](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/telescope-2-0-2)\n\nPlease share your feedback and let us know what you think! ",
