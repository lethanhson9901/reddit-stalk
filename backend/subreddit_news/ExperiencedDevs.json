During some discussion, I asked if we should validate against \"555\" numbers, like `(XXX) 555-XXXX`. \n\nJunior dev asked me what \"555\" numbers where.\n\nSo in order to asauge my feelings of old age, anyone want to share their personal \"Damn, I'm old\" moments?",

He was in his late fifties and had been a software engineer all his life. He joined us to work on a migration project to move customers from an old COBOL platform to a brand-new TypeScript platform that heavily used Kafka and Postgres with a custom engine to keep space low. He was struggling a little with TypeScript, but quickly got the hang of things and was a joy to work with. We completed the migration, and he promptly retired afterwards. During his last few weeks he told us that his first job was at IBM, where he worked for a client to build a COBOL platform - the very one he had just deprecated. He retired as a software engineer delivering the replacement to his first ever project. He kept it pretty quiet around most of the team, but said that it felt like a great time to leave software as a lifetime of working at a desk had taken its toll.\n\nI believe he has *technically* un-retired, because he sells pottery and upholstered rescued furniture now, but it's a nice story I never tire of sharing.",

Don't know. \n\nThe first kicker, I just joined last month as an internal transfer. The second kicker, the manager is also leaving and the last experienced member is leaving next week.\n\nNext month, the team and project will be reduced down to just myself. \n\nThere are some things to point out tho:\n1. The project isn't going away. It literally exists because of regulatory purposes\n2. Upper management is dedicating effort to hire for this team specifically. \n\nRight now I'm taking this as a blank slate and to build the team back up in the direction I want. But until then, I got another week to try to absorb everything I can from the last remaining engineer, and to make sure things are running as usual for the time being.

Bad management might continue or might change a bit seeing the consequences (need to rehire the team). But if they have compliance issues, then the risk for you is higher. \n\nTalk with everyone you can get hold of from the old team and try to figure out the situation. \n\nIf you receive compliance training from the company, pay attention. For example a possible GDPR breach can mean a legal case and fine for the company. But Anti Money Laundering laws have strict reporting obligations, and even engineers could go to jail failing to report a breach. You would want to understand what type of regulatory the team is covering and what does it mean for you. \n\nAssuming the others are leaving because of bad management: you have some leverage now to negotiate your position in the team and how processes around the team should work. Meaning you could ask for adjustments, but would need to know what to ask for, what was difficult earlier.\n\nDon't assume that you will lead the team just because you are the only engineer left. If you want to be a team lead, discuss with the manager(s) and get an agreement now. Ask them what do they need from a lead and listen carefully. I would ask for being involved in the hiring also, preferably owning the quality evaluation of the candidates.\n\nFor knowledge transfer: soak up as much as possible, but also ask them to document things and make a video recording of the knowledge sharing sessions if possible. \n\nRebuilding a team from scratch can be a valuable learning experience for you. Both the hiring and building up team processes from scratch."

It'll be months before a functioning team is put into place, and without a manager, it will be rudderless for a while.\n\n2) Stay. Take ownership over the whole project: planning, execution, review, build the team up, and onboard a new manager. If you just hang in there, you'll naturally be in a leadership position just through seniority, and that's a big plus for whatever manager is coming in and what's to get set up.\n\nPersonally, I'd jump ship right now, but at other points in my career I'd want to simply coast. I've been on a team that had the same thing happen, and basically the whole project ground to a halt. Eventually that project became a main focus for the company (we were a start up), but at the time the outlook went from leading a team of 4 people, to the project just being myself.\n\nHowever, the company, the expectations on you, and the overall disposition of management will determine what's a good idea or not. Sometimes teams just get downsized to a few \"keep in place\" warm bodies and go into maintainence mode. That's really not good for your career, but it can work, as long as management keeping the project around lets them get whatever they want.\n\nLots of factors, so there's no clear answer. That said, a bias towards working on up and coming projects is always best for your long term career outlook."

Company was run by an extremely narcissistic CEO who was slinging a sledgehammer for the sake of slinging a sledgehammer. No political tact. Anyways, started shedding our talent real quick because it was obvious this place would be a nightmare to stick around for. I felt I was further justified in jumping ship myself, as one person who stuck behind for the promised 33% raise on good performance was never given that raise after the allotted year. The expectations were impossible. As in: dev with 2-3 years experience was expected to replace 20 years of genuine talent on a rather complex data heavy product, at the same velocity of feature addition/improvement/fixes, on day 1. With little to no mentorship.\n\nSide 2: Just joined a company because a friend poached me (made it in on merit I promise! they just referenced me and said \"more moneys.\"). A lot of the old guard at the level I joined at was wildly incompetent. Company was rapidly growing from small to medium and the old ways weren't going to cut it. We're talking 20 year old tech stacks with little thought for growth when designed and a refusal to improve their situation when faced with the weight of the tech debt and ensuing issues as we scale. A lot of them left on their own accord, likely due to the pressure, upper management turned down their requested raises, and with one or two straight up fired. Whole team was replaced in less than a year, and the current team is still going strong 5 years later, with many more members added and far more power through the organization than they've ever had.\n\nSo, my point in these examples is this: socialize with those around you (management, as well as the team members who are leaving/left) and get a feel for what's really going on here. Is the company experiencing significant growth and is there an \"old guard\" or \"good old boys\" feeling across those who are leaving, or across management? Do things need to be sledgehammered because they won't work for the business, or are they being sledgehammered because management thinks everything is a nail when you're actually making screws? Make your choice based off what you see. Either way, sticking around for a bit to figure out what's happening is probably in your best interest. At least you'll get a paycheck out of it for a while."

I wouldn't say that the power void is necessarily a lane open to you, and it depends on where the valuable parts of the product are. If I were you, I'd make sure I was staffed in the most impactful parts of the org to best leverage my experience. I didn't do this (I stayed in a reliability focussed role instead of a high-leverage scale and automation role) and think it was ultimately a mistake for me. To come back to the initial point, imagine that new external hires are best-in-class with a ton of experience in the specific domain - not much room for you to grow up into. My story was joining an infra team, getting a ton of experience, team gutted, a bunch of effort spent plugging holes with the goal of moving into a staff position, then the company poaching someone who had done the exact same role with the exact same tech at AWS at scale - it was the right move for the business, but I pretty much had to find another role after that if I wanted to grow.\n\nAlso understand that being one of the only people who knows how things work is not necessarily advantageous. People will use you as a crutch (as they should), but you may not get recognized for that. Look out for yourself and make sure you have high impact assignments before helping others."

There would be a lot of reverse engineering but if domain knowledge is present in organization it is not so bad.  \n  \nDo you have competent management who has idea how to move forward? Ask the skip manager what is the plan. Do they have a strong road map or their plan is a lot of hand-waving.\n\nLook at the code and documentation. Does it look like the project has an architecture or is it all just a spaghetti? Are tests working and can you consider them a documenation as a code?\n\n\n\nWhat can you do:\n\nHave honest talk with experienced guy leaving. Make him give you a tech talk on how to set up the environment, how did the team develop features in the past, most important profiles, flags, tables. If possible ask your manager to hire some of the guys as consultant for knowledge transfer. Record the talk! This will become a holy scripture for you and new team members. A memory of civilization lost. Try to reach out to people who \"left\". There is a good chance there are stull in the organization just on the garden leave until end of month.\n\nHow was it to me:\n\nNot all of my team left but the last two experienced people who could actually do the work were about to leave. The rest of the team were juniors who didn't know much about software development. I raised alarm to the manager and... nothing happened. Zero fs given. i saw one of the juniors bail by asking for team transfer. Business side was mess as well. It was a project in legacy technologies without tests with some non-standard solutions. Since I didn't wanted to be left as a guy for cleaning up the mess I requested team transfer as well as a second guy. \n\n  \nI am not sure what happened after but I know some time later the organization came up with FooApp 2.0 in newer technologies so my guess its that they made a full rewrite as a cover up for \"we allowed all people who could support FooApp 1.0 to leave\""

My manager has been delaying my development plan towards my promotion for over a year stating there are no topics available for him to give me the full responsibility associated with L5. \n\nMeanwhile there's another guy who's also at L4 and on the same promotional path to L5. He has gotten a whole new product assigned to him by my manager for launching it as a MVP followed by a generalized availability, so that's part of his promotional plan and also it aligns with the company's OKR for the year. \n\nAfter a lot of \"begging\" I was given a topic to own but it's not a product in itself but rather an internal technincal process that doesn't align directly with the company's OKR as it doesn't generate revenue but simply an internals process improvement which is also a major topic that is nice to have but no significant company wide visibility or importance for management. \n\nSince no one wanted to pick it up because of the nature of this task, I was let to have it. All good, I have been taking its development forward, establishing processes, testing it, making releases, supporting it and creating backlogs. \n\nBut having changed multiple jobs over 12 years I know a bluff when I see one. Recently another new product came up that directly aligns with my company's OKR because it will generate revenue and I have been for long looking for an opportunity that will have direct  impact on the company's revenue to take up as part of my development plan in order to prove my capabilities and become visibile to the higher management for my promotion. \n\nBecause it is a direct customer facing product ''s technical responsibility it will strengthen my L5 development plan and bring me management visibility. Since my manager is being lazy with me and is delaying me an opportunity to take up higher responsibilities that involves cross team communication, collaboration, motivating people, driving business to generate value within the company which this project has the capacity to do so, I asked my manager to be assigned to this project. \n\nHis reply was you have mostly worked alone on projects over the years since you have been here and I can't assign you to this topic otherwise you would again be alone and I need to see how you work in a team. I have been collaborating with other team members in my current tasks, reviewing design and code with architects that are affected by this process improvement and working with developers in adapting this process improvement in their projects within my team.\n\nIs my manager justified in denying me tasks that he knows would help my cause? As far as he has told me there's no fighting for the L5 availability because it's open for all who is qualified but maybe I should be skeptical towards it as well. What would be a good way to convince my manager? I have stated all the functional and technical issues impacts I have been making but he doesn't seem interested in them and circles back to the same point. What should I make of it? Any advice is highly appreciated? ",

You may think you've done a lot of teamwork, but your manager does not perceive it that way.\n\nYou should try to understand exactly what your manager wants to see so you can work on that. Don't be afraid to ask for coaching or advice. You need to let go of your idea that you've been doing enough teamwork and be open to working with your manager.\n\nIn the context of your current task, you said:\n\n>Since no one wanted to pick it up because of the nature of this task, I was let to have it. All good, I have been taking its development forward, establishing processes, testing it, making releases, supporting it and creating backlogs.\n\nWhich parts of this have you been doing in a team context? I know it's not the most interesting task, but are there opportunities for teamwork? Pursue those. If you can't think of any, ask your manager for coaching.\n\nFinally, I think it's important that you finish this current task you were assigned before pushing hard to request more work. You asked for a specific task to prove yourself and you were given one. It would not be a good look if you de-prioritized it at the first opportunity to jump to something else. You need to demonstrate that you can own something from start to finish without getting bored or changing tasks if you want a promotion.",

For the local developer experience (when I'm working on project A and also want to make additions to the common library) we would have both projects running with dev servers and we would use npm link from project A to the design library project so it would use the files being built in the design library instead of the ones in it's own local node\\_modules (which required us to build to disk instead of in memory for the design library in local dev webpack config). I can't recall if HMR worked, and npm link could be problematic in other ways (library compatibility was even more critical, I can't remember more).\n\nA process-based alternative we had for a different company was to have the central library as a private npm package, but make alterations or new components within the consuming project (Project A again) to provide them out and have fast feedback loops, then once things were good have a separate sub-task to add it into the design library, flesh out storybook, etc. You could build your feature for Project A and push it out, build the component change in the Design Library and push it out, then have a final task in Project A to advance the version of the design library in package.json and pull down the fresh one, remove the local implementation of the component, and fixup the import and any other changes that happened to the component in the 2nd version. This had the advantage of HMR and fast feedback loops during initial development, the disadvantage of it being a process with extra steps, but it also meant the final shareable component was the second go around and sometimes got improved or cleaned up further because now you knew how it needed to work but were writing it for a wider audience."

The biggest hump was creating a build process which we solved by using D-in-D (Docker in Docker) which runs an image that builds the NPMs.\n\nAs someone noted here, NPMs can be a black box. So we have multiple NPMs that rely on other private NPMs. There is one base one for mixins and SASS/LESS. Then depending on product, there are NPMs for creating the layout shell, auth, personalized data,etc. All those secondary NPMs rely on the first which is the global corporate design CSS/patterns/mixins. You can't deviate from the corporate design. So if a new pattern like a modal alert needs to be built, it needs to be built in the base first layer NPM. Tagged, then the other NPMS and apps have to pull latest tag.\n\nSo the issue is if you are working on that first one, it hasn't been tagged yet. So the secondary and third NPMS requiring that as a dependency won't build. So D-in-D solved it. It does the build, push it to a docker running  internal repo, local devs just pick it up from an environment variable in their local/QA/lower environment. Test everything before committing the base NPM. Has been solid for years."

We were given RTO orders around a year ago, which means I've been going into the large nearby office x4 a week with only one other coworker in my department.\n\nI was informed recently that this RTO was not cutting it, and that I need to relocate to a tech hub office, all 4 of which are in other states.\n\nIf I don't relocate, I would be let go around August and given a 6 month severance package.\n\nI'm not truly interested in staying with my company for all the usual reasons: this was my first job out of college and the next promotion would be 6 years away/I'm not getting the mentorship and support I need/my life is in my current state and I want to stay. I am ready for a new hybrid job where I can actually be with my team in person and get technical and professional mentorship. \n\nIn my personal life, the plan was to move in with my partner this year. I would prefer to do this and live off severance + savings and focus on finding a new job. \n\nHowever, I'm worried about giving up a job in this market, especially living in a HCOL area.\n\nDo I take the offer as a backup, study and interview like crazy until I'm forced to move by July, and then worst case scenario relocate?\n\nThe location I'd pick is the next state over in a MCOL city where no coworkers or managers are located. I'd rent a furnished apartment and hide out there, continuing to study and interview until I land a new position. Obviously though I'd be physically isolated from my support system and likely miserable.\n\nOn my team I'm considered a good developer, but we push more paperwork than code. I got my ass kicked in technical interviews out of college, and actually got this job with no whiteboarding/take home problems (instead collaborated on a word problem with my old manager + was asked technical questions), so while I'm starting to dive into the leetcode grind I am nervous about it.\n\nIs having a job while interviewing worth putting my life on pause in this market?\n\nTL;DR: Company is requiring relocation to another state by summer, do I take 6 months severance in August and run or do I move and continue to interview for my next job while I'm out there?\n",

Maybe dial back effort at your current job to 70%.\n\nLeetcode isn't everything, make sure you're studying system design (I watch mock interviews and make Anki flashcards) and can talk in depth about your current and past jobs and communicate that you've had impactful, non-junior responsibilities.\n\nAs for what you should do if it gets to July and you still don't have an offer, that's a bit tougher.

I know it might be hard to hear but this company is doing right by you compared to the horror stories we\u2019ve heard recently."

From the PM?\n- Once you have a work item, how do you scope/design it? For small tickets? For larger projects?\n- How frequently do you deploy changes? Is there interest-team coordination required? (From here, launch into CI/CD of your like)\n- How involved is upper-management in planning? Do they just set OKRs? Do they share the \u201cwhy\u201d along with the \u201cwhat\u201d?\n\nMore junior interviewers may just say that the Tech Lead worries about that, and you can pivot into more day-to-day questions.
