This kind of momentum is encouraging and indicates the startup is finding its market and customers.\n\nFor a bootstrap effort in just a few months, it\u2019s a strong validation. Scaling from here will likely involve refining the product, understanding the customers better, and potentially exploring marketing to reach a wider audience.

Since the model is smaller and pretty cheap, the cost to run it is not a lot. Maybe about a few pennies per song generation.

When I started in October, I did a ton of research and couldn\u2019t find anything that did what I had in mind. So, I decided to build it myself.\n\nI spent countless nights and weekends learning how to code (thank you YouTube and Cursor.ai) and finally launched last Sunday on uneed.best. To my surprise, it actually took 1st place! I was thrilled... until I discovered that someone else had launched a similar app a month ago.\n\nNow I\u2019m stuck wondering what to do next:\n\n- Should I scrap the idea altogether?\n- Double down and differentiate my product to stand out?\n- Or just go all-in and try to out-market them (if only I had the budget, lol)?\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it?",

Damn, for my web app I spammed it out in all my group chats got feedback and iterated and then asked people to share with their friends. \n\nArguably building things is now the easy part. The hard part is now making your web app defensible through building a brand with it and iterating on it faster than others by listening to feedback and honing on solving user's problems.\n\ntl;dr - Don't scrap it, keep going until you've made your first sale. Because everything you learn up until that point will be invaluable and pay dividends down the line if you have to shelve this project and start another one.\n\nYou got this!",

Looking back, I\u2019ve worked on problems I\u2019ve personally faced, but I tended to overengineer, thinking you needed a ton of features and perfect design to attract users. About 4\u20135 years ago, I stopped completely. It was too time-consuming, and I decided to focus on my career and family instead.\n\nLast year, around Easter, I wanted to create something small to solve a small problem I had, while ensuring to do the opposite of what I\u2019d done before. This time I would just add a bare minimum of features and launch. I spent about three weeks creating the first version of [BodyState](https://www.bodystate.app), an app to track personal energy levels throughout the day. At the time, I had just switched from a Garmin to an Apple Watch Ultra and missed Garmin\u2019s Body Battery feature. I figured this would also be a good way to learn SwiftUI.\n\nThe app gave me value, so I [posted about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/1c2ildr/body_battery_for_apple_watch/) on the Apple Watch subreddit. To my surprise, it got a lot of engagement and around 2,000 installs overnight. About 50% of the users had issues (crashing or data not loading), but it made me realize this was something a lot of people had been missing. I quickly created a subreddit to connect with users, and the app has been growing ever since. It recently passed 85,000 downloads, and it\u2019s been such a fun project to work on.\n\nThe app is free, but users can support development with $5, $10, or $15. Supporters unlock different themes and can customize the app icon to make it look even cooler. I\u2019ve been surprised at how many people are happy to contribute, and while I still work full-time, it has become a meaningful side income.\n\nIf I were to share what helped me get here, beyond having some level of product-market fit, it would be:\n\n1. Launching while I was still embarrassed about the product\n2. Creating a subreddit to engage with users\n3. Not requiring an account\n4. Avoiding ads\n5. Focusing on complete privacy with all data processed on the device\n6. Not focusing on monetization from the start\n\nIf you have an Apple Watch, you can check out the app [here](https://apps.apple.com/no/app/bodystate/id6479940325) and join our [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyState/).",

By the time I finished development, Etsy was flooded with generated art. \n\nLessons learned:\n- First prove out the idea in the most simplest way possible (it would\u2019ve been better if I just listed images that I processed manually - seems obvious but given the low margins on Etsy I figured automation was key to make it into a profitable business)\n- Consider the full cost of producing the product and the profitability (there were still some manual steps in the process (generating images in Midjourney because they don\u2019t have an API) and while I still could\u2019ve made money, it was just not worth my time and effort (a better side hustle for someone who\u2019s not the breadwinner in the family like I was).\n- Advertising on Etsy is essential (I did finally list some images, but got virtually no views)"

First, instead of using traditional cold ads, build an *exclusive community funnel*. Start by running ads offering free access to a private Instagram group where members get insider tips or tutorials related to your SaaS niche. Inside the group, subtly position your product as the essential tool everyone there needs. Second, tap into *micro-moments marketing*. Create carousel posts or short Reels that answer hyper-specific questions or pain points your audience Googles but doesn\u2019t expect to find on Instagram\u2014this builds instant trust. Third, leverage *hidden lookalike audiences*. Instead of basing your ads on obvious customer data, create a lookalike audience of people following Instagram accounts that serve complementary (but not competing) niches, giving you a fresh pool of untapped leads.\n\nThese strategies are rarely explored, so you\u2019re welcome to try them yourself if you\u2019re up for the challenge. But if you\u2019re looking for a proven approach tailored to your business, I\u2019ve already refined these ideas into a system designed to deliver results. You can experiment on your own or partner with me to make it happen\u2014it\u2019s up to you!",

When two QR codes have different patterns at the same position, the cell is split diagonally - one half represents the first QR code and the other half represents the second QR code. When both QR codes have the same pattern at a position (both black or both white), the cell is filled with a solid color. Due to the high error correction capability of QR codes (using error correction level 'H'), QR code scanners can still read either URL depending on the scanning angle, though as noted in the UI, it tends to favor the second URL more frequently.\n\nIt is not perfect and I am still trying to get a more reliable image scan and 50/50 URL split, but I think it is a cool PoC!\n\nhttps://dualqrcode.com/"

It\u2019s like a little gift from your past self to keep you motivated!\n\nYou can easily track your progress on a dedicated page and stay on course without distractions.\n\nI wanted to keep the interface clean and easy to use, so it feels encouraging rather than overwhelming. If you\u2019ve been want to simplify your journey of building habits, l\u2019d love for you to check it out. I got 10 promo codes for lifetime subscription, just DM me to get them.\n\n[App Store Link](https://apple.co/3PKwNIP)\n\nFeedback, thoughts, or just saying \u201chi\u201d are always welcome!

Your feedback will help shape future updates\u2014what works well, what\u2019s missing, and what would make **Applausible** even better.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Plausible user and want a simpler way to keep track of your website stats, you can check out **Applausible** [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/applausible/id6737839249).

First, instead of using traditional cold ads, build an *exclusive community funnel*. Start by running ads offering free access to a private Instagram group where members get insider tips or tutorials related to your SaaS niche. Inside the group, subtly position your product as the essential tool everyone there needs. Second, tap into *micro-moments marketing*. Create carousel posts or short Reels that answer hyper-specific questions or pain points your audience Googles but doesn\u2019t expect to find on Instagram\u2014this builds instant trust. Third, leverage *hidden lookalike audiences*. Instead of basing your ads on obvious customer data, create a lookalike audience of people following Instagram accounts that serve complementary (but not competing) niches, giving you a fresh pool of untapped leads.\n\nThese strategies are rarely explored, so you\u2019re welcome to try them yourself if you\u2019re up for the challenge. But if you\u2019re looking for a proven approach tailored to your business, I\u2019ve already refined these ideas into a system designed to deliver results. You can experiment on your own or partner with me to make it happen\u2014it\u2019s up to you!"

            "author": "NeroScore",
            "text": "Hey Reddit! I wanted to share an exciting journey about how our app,[ X Mirror \u2013 CarPlay Screen Mirroring](https://apps.apple.com/mt/app/xmirror-screen-mirroring/id6469104483?platform=iphone), climbed to the top of Taiwan's free app ranking in just one night. (No.1 as productivity tools, and No.6 in the total ranking board)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjsw1m6l1vee1.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=76c912013595ad5cf71d829d874cc42018336c23\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5h3dyd0h1vee1.png?width=1573&format=png&auto=webp&s=0595631b24699e658165e7e957e5014e6afbeb71\n\nHere\u2019s the story behind it and what we learned:\n\nThe Background: We launched X Mirror last year as a side project. Initially, it only got a few organic downloads and minimal revenue ($0 in the past few months). Growth was stagnant, and we weren\u2019t sure what to do next. But after one bold move, we got over 1.4k downloads overnight and hit No. 1 on Taiwan\u2019s free app ranking!\n\n# What We Did:\n\n1. **Made It Free for a Month** We decided to make the app completely free for one month. The goal? To attract more target users, gather authentic feedback, and improve the app based on real user insights. It was a risky move, but we felt it was worth a shot to restart growth, it can't be worse anyway.\n2. **Spread the Word Across Platforms** We promoted the free campaign across multiple platforms and regions.\n   * **English-Speaking Regions**: Reddit turned out to be a goldmine. We got meaningful interactions, and within a day, this alone drove over 600 downloads in the US.\n   * **China Mainland**: We collaborated with related WeChat official accounts, getting some free promotion through their network.\n   * **Taiwan**: We tried multiple channels, including Reddit and forums, but initially saw little traction.\n3. **The Power of Organic Spread** Initially, our promotion in Taiwan seemed like a flop. But thanks to our multilingual preparation, the app caught the attention of influential X accounts, who gained a considerable impression, and the post later got re-tweeted and shared on PTT (Taiwan's largest forum). These posts sparked a wave of organic interest, leading to an immediate, massive surge in downloads and catapulting *X Mirror* to No. 1 on Taiwan\u2019s free app chart overnight.\n\n# Lessons Learned:\n\n* **Right Target Area**: In terms of app positioning - Our app targeting CarPlay screen mirroring, and especially Tesla carplay screen mirroring. There is a huge gap between the existing product and user need to start with. In terms of regional choice - We chose the US, China and Taiwan to start with for the potential market value.\n* **Pre-Work Pays Off**: Carefully planning, collaborating, and promoting across multiple platforms helped build momentum.\n* **Luck Matters, of course**: Getting picked up by influential accounts and forums played a huge role, even though we didn\u2019t anticipate it.\n\nThe best part? We didn\u2019t spend a single penny on ads! It was all about strategic targeting, consistent effort, and a bit of good fortune.\n\nFinally, if you're interested in this free offer, you can get it from App Store: [X Mirror \u2013 CarPlay Screen Mirroring](https://apps.apple.com/mt/app/xmirror-screen-mirroring/id6469104483?platform=iphone) (The offer will end on 28th Feb)",
