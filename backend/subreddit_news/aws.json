            "text": "Hey all.\n\nUse SAM, CDK and recently terraform.  \n\nOne of my team mistakenly added a Lambda to a VPC so i removed  the VPC. It take > 30 minutes to update the lambda and delete the security group. For this project we use TF.  When i have done this in the past via CDK, it would normally take ages to complete the action.  I thought that it would be a lot smoother in TF through.  Is there a trick to do it so we don\u2019t end up waiting 30 minutes? ",

However, they depreciated it.\n\nIIRC, the issue is that the lambda orphans the eni, which TF has no control over. \n\nWhen it tries to delete the SG though, it\u2019s still attached to that AWS managed eni\u2026 which is cleaned up lazily by AWS. So, it can take a while and hold up your TF destroy operation.",

You also have to find the ENI associated with the Lambda, before the VpcConfig is updated, and once the update is done, wait for the ENI to be cleaned up; it takes ~30 seconds. Then you can delete the Lambda.\n\nI usually achieve this via a custom resource in CloudFormation, no idea how you'd do that in TF"

You then either need to delete these ENIs manually or you need to create yet another function to clean up these \"leftover ENIs\".\n\nI really hope AWS enhances this functionality because its a pain for every CICD user to deal with VPC-based Lambda functions.",

Until those ENIs get removed, you cannot remove security groups using them.\n\nThere is nothing you can do about it, unfortunately. Per AWS support (as I have personally queried this), it is working as intended.\n\nYou used to be able to work around it by swapping security groups around on the ENI (and Terraform's AWS provider used to do this too) but AWS pushed a change that prevents customers amending hyperplane ENIs after creation when they are associated with the Lambda.\n\nMy guess is AWS have some kind of batch process that reaps these rather than it being on demand for internal performance reasons, but it is a terrible user experience when you are developing with IaC and may wish to create and destroy resources a lot to ensure things work correctly."

After running the app and in the docker container locally and successfully hitting the health check endpoint, I haven\u2019t had any luck being able to deploy on ECS fargate. The behavior I currently see is the cluster spins up a task, the health check fails without any status code, and then a new task is spun up. Cloudwatch is also unfortunately not showing me any logs and I have also validated the security group config is good between the alb and application. Does anyone have any guidance for how I can resolve this?",
