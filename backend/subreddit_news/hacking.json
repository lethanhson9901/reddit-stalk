Your only home would be to block the numbers or change the number. Blocking the numbers is a bit useless if it's not paired with a pattern spam marker. So basically you'll need an app that is capable of flagging similar numbers with the ones you have manually flagged and block incoming SMS or calls. Not sure what app to recommend, but changing the number seems the easier way. \nAlso how frequent are the messages?",

With the new number reactivate 2fa although I would recommend using a 2fa app if your able to(Microsoft Authenticator) you may want to create a new email that you use specifically for sensitive accounts and no where else."

Just because they have a patent doesn't mean they're using it, and it certainly doesn't mean they're using it _in this game_. \n\n2. Just because a dll is loaded, doesn't mean that it's used. \n\n3. Just because a dll is used, doesn't mean it's *fully* used. There could be a helper function (like a useful math function) that's available in that driver that the game is using without engaging the camera hardware.\n\n4. nvCamera is an NVidia driver -- not a driver distributed in windows or CoD. It seems likely that initializing the suite of NVidia drivers (SDK) includes this driver.\n\n5. DLLs are still run within the security context of their host processes. In this case, it's either the context of the video card drivers or the context of the game itself. I believe that this would be within the context of the game and, if so, the code in any DLL referenced by the game would not have wide open access to your whole system (_unless you run the game as administrator_). There's no evidence provided that the nvCamera DLL is a dependency of the anti-cheat software or video card drivers (that would have elevated access).\n\n6. If you use NVidia Experience, it adds an overlay to games that supports live streaming _with camera overlay_. This will absolutely load nvCamera. I don't know the particulars, but it's entirely possible that the NVidia Experience overlay may be injected into the game process and would appear as though it's loaded by the game, even though the game doesn't directly depend on that DLL.\n\nI'm with /u/nachoism -- without a technical write up this is garbage.",

It is extremely annoying when people who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing make uninformed grandiose statements.  \n\nFirstly, NOTHING and I mean NOTHING is suspicious about ntdll. Ntdll is a system module meant for interacting with the kernel. EVERY SINGLE WINDOWS PROCESS USES IT. ALL OF THEM. IF YOURE RUNING A GAME ON WINDOWS ITS IN THERE. \n\nWhich brings me to the next dumbass statement.   \u201cThis other game had 0 dlls\u201d. As I stated before. Not possible. All processes load a select few dlls for the system.  \n\nThirdly, them importing NvCamera does not mean they\u2019re spying on your webcam. Every executable whether it\u2019s process or dll or whatever will import dlls and if they rely on other dlls they will import them. Let\u2019s say that you use a prebuilt game engine that may want to allow the people who use that engine to access the camera. The engine is going to use that dll. There are literally a billion reasons they might import it, if the person who did this investigation knew what they were doing they would be analyzing behavior beyond seeing what dlls get imported. \n\nAnd finally they link a patents vaguely about facial scanning and point to that as proof that cod is spying on you with 0 evidence.\n\nJust a little due diligence would be nice."

Today i've stumbled upon a CTF that uses a simple anti-dbg measure, using just ptrace and PTRACE\\_TRACEME flag. By gathering some infos I saw that there is a simple hook I can use, suing the LD\\_PRELOAD flag. I did some tests on some programs that i wrote and seems effective. The problem about the CTF is that uses a dlopen of a specific lib in the system, it seems to be more relevant than the custom lib that I load with that flag obviously. Maybe I can solve the problem with patching but first I want to try solving the thing this way. Clearly there is something that I am missing here. I post here also the code if it might help.\n\n  `ptrace_sym = 0x61727470;`\n\n  `local_1b = 0x6563;`\n\n  `local_19 = 0;`\n\n  `libhandle = dlopen(\"libc.so.6\",1);`\n\n  `if (libhandle == 0) {`\n\n`/* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */`\n\n`exit(1);`\n\n  `}`\n\n  `sym = (code *)dlsym(libhandle,&ptrace_sym);`\n\n  `if (sym == (code *)0x0) {`\n\n`/* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */`\n\n`exit(1);`\n\n  `}`\n\n  `(*sym)(0,0);`  \n",
