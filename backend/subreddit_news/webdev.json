The Spec doesn't SEEM to mention it, but MDN is addament they are ALWAYS stored as DOMString representation.\n\nEDIT: Some research, it is implementation specific, and I guess Chromium uses LevelsDB, which can store things as ascii or utf-16 as needed. My understanding is the JS engine itself (V8, JSC, and SpiderMonkey) will also all use ASCII strings when the string is pure ASCII, and then use DOMString when it's not pure ascii"

Holding onto large amounts of memory causes slowdowns. Not that being concerned about memory isn't important, but in this case, it has to be done somehow, and this will generally not be that large, and is relatively \"cheap\".\n\nThere is not any way to get the size of the local storage without using more RAM somehow...

I basically built out his entire online presence, created and planned out his social media activity, email campaigns, the one agreement is that I'm not an artist.\n\nIt's also clear he's frustrated with the assets, when that's hilariously out of of scope.

Personally I like to have the client work directly with the designer, so I don't have to think about it.\n\nIf the client has a previous designer they've worked with, reach out to them and see if they want to work with the client again on this project. Maybe they'll become your go-to designer. If you have someone else in mind, reach out to them.\n\nPersonally I would tell the client flat out I cannot do that. I'd tell them I'm a plumber and they're looking for an electrician.

Set a token limit if money's tight. Work on parts each day. Ask it to make a basic Express server, using Vue.js for the front-end. Cline recently added a Plan/Act switch that may help you to learn by studying what it will do before it does it. I know Cursor and other tools are popular too but I've only tried Bolt and Cline.

            "text": "A bit of background: I am building an accounting web platform with a friend. After the christmas holidays, we stopped a little, and when i came back from vacation i found myself reqlly bored.\n\nNow, i am very passionate about programming, and two days ago i was like \"Hey, i just bought a tablet, so what if i make a small android app to natively output my graphs on tablet?\" and so i started.\n\nFirst step was to make the server output the data to plot. Easy enough. A thing to know about the \"server\" is that i needed a laptop when i started the project, my idea was to get a laptop, install apache and everything, and host the platform there. I did not want to buy an overpriced laptop, so i just bought an ssd and installed it on a laptop i had at home. That laptop is more than 10 years old, it was already super cheap when i got it, it has 4 gb ram and i think a 2ghz dual core cpu. Back to the main line.\n\nSo i made the server output what i needed, but i wanted more. I wanted it to show me in detail everything it had in the database, and output it as a json object. It worked, so i coded the app side, send a network request, get the json string output and decode it. I run it. Doesn't work. \"Wait, what?\" i tell myself. I run it on the laptop, it works. How come a PHP file outputs the values if i go with the browser but it doesn't with a network request? Weird. Check the URL (because it is passed by another function), URL is good. Check the file name. All good. \"Okay, then let's see your problem\" i tell myself why making the app output the network response. And there it was, it was glorious: TIMED OUT. There i understood the problem.\n\nIn order to have the values i needed, i made the server run one too many nested for loops. That ancient laptop couldn't handle everything, and the SDK i use for android simply timed out.\n\nI quickly found a way to make the backend code more efficient and in the end it ended up working perfectly as intended.\n\nThe lesson i take away from this: to make my software more efficient, i should ALWAYS run it on a single core 2ghz machine. Lesson learned.\n\nThanks for listening. ",

We already have many things that we need to use libs or write some JS abstraction and CSS hacks to overcome non-customizable HTML built-ins like checkboxes, date pickers, and many other inputs. I just realized or maybe have the misconception that built-in HTML validation is overcomplicated and could be much more extensible with a more idiomatic approach with HTML.\n\n>and can pretty easily implement most of the HTML element cases via eg input:user-invalid + .validation and other similar pseudo-classes.

Having the current built-in form validation together with another one will overlap and cause many issues.",

Just setting `required` gives you \"This input is required\". Similar for `setCustomValidity()`.\n\nIf you really want to implement it, my instinct is a web component with typical form-related attributes (`form`, `for`, etc). Have `<slot>` for the different validation error types. Add an `invalid` listener on `connectedCallback()` and remove it on `disconnectedCallback()`, possibly changing it via `attributeChangedCallback()`. Find the relevant input easily by `document.forms[this.form].elements[this.for]`."

We still can solve this with pseudo-classes just like the other comment showed. But it's much more idiomatic to write some HTML for that.\n\nThe second problem is my main point. I'm aware that we currently can handle validation, and customize it, but it's not worth it even for simple pages if the UX and UI matter, then we end up using JS for something that maybe we could just write some markup.\n\nThe issues with adding what I suggested are kind of a fantasy tbh, very hard to make it work with how browsers currently handle validation I think, still current built-in HTML validation seems like a very bad design choice to me. Seems like a very important visual piece that could be just easy to write and style needs a lot of overhead to work.",

Discuss the purpose of the website with them then give them a list of the content you require to start designing. If they aren't meeting the deadlines you set for content, give them a call and go through your list. Make lots of notes. Write what you need or send your notes to a web copywriter. It can be like pulling teeth to get people to write a 150 word blurb but they will chat for 30 minutes easy.\n\nYou don't need 100% of the content to start designing. But be careful of too much placeholder. I've found clients are more likely to not give you the info you need, sections get removed, and the design starts to fall apart.\n\nIt's tough to make something look good when you have nothing to work with. So impress the importance of content, work with them to get that content, then make a great website."
