I\u2019ve worked in a few startups already, so here\u2019s how I approached it:\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s pretty similar to finding a corporate job, but it relies way more on networking. I attended startup events and kept an eye out for startups that sounded interesting to me. I\u2019d ask the founders directly if they were looking for employees and where I could apply. Most of the time, they\u2019d tell me to apply through their website, but sometimes they\u2019d give me their personal email instead.\n\nAnother job I landed at a startup was through my previous experience at a VC. VCs know which of their portfolio companies are looking for talent, so they\u2019ll sometimes recommend you to hire directly.\n\nHope that helps!",

Your alumni network is a good place to start, along with seeing what startups are related to the university where you got your PhD. The first startup I joined was doing work at the university where I was getting my PhD, so I approached them to see if they needed an engineer. At the time, they were contracting work at the university that was very similar to what I was doing for my thesis. I got hired as their first full-time employee.\n\nWellfound is a site where startups will post jobs. Many VCs will also post jobs available at their portfolio companies. You can also check LinkedIn. Many times, though, due to the potential high costs of recruiting, startups will hire through word-of-mouth. Which comes right back to networking!\n\nConsidering you have a PhD, then you likely have specialized knowledge and experience that will fit really well with the right startup. Take a targeted approach to finding those startups where your skill set will be invaluable. Even if they don't have a job posted, it can't hurt to contact them. Maybe you can initially consult with them and eventually get hired. This is how I got my 2nd startup job.\n\nGood luck!",

Or, you want the business to already have stabilized with decently sized teams, but that's probably beyond what you'd call an interesting time; so you'd be back to simply doing a regular job.\n\nMy most helpful advice would be to network within your local startup scene. Get a feel for what's out there, whom to trust, and hopefully get noticed by some investors that would want your particular skills to help strengthen a business that they've already invested in.\n\nAs always, start with [meetup.com](http://meetup.com) and see where that takes you."

You have a Phd, you can always go back to corp if you need the cash, but the oportunity to work on somthing legitimately interesting is worth taking a short term financial hit. Also, working at an early stage startup you should be able to haggle your way into a title/job that's well in advance of where you are in the corp world. If it falls apart after ~3 years (as many do) when you go back to the job hunt you'll be doing it with a much more advanced title. Working at a start up is a great way to leapfrog people in more stable corporate life who tend to experience much slower role advancement."

What do you bring to the table the others can\u2019t? What does a startup need to make it worth their time, risk, and cost of opportunity. \n\nEspecially if you can\u2019t pay them. \n\nThe best tech cofounder I ever had came on because I was already selling and masking revenue with an MVP as a consultant. Not only did I share my idea and vision, I shared my ability to execute and sell. We started off with one project and built chemistry from there. Eventually we interviewed at YC. Every milestone built more trust and commitment. \n\nThis is if you have the idea first. An even better way is to find a problem they want to work on and show that you have founder-market fit. Show them your potential to get initial traction and let them focus on what they want to do. \n\nDreams and promises mean nothing to a competent programmer that could easily stay at their cushy job or have multiple opportunities. \n\nAnother founder I know was a car salesman. He went out and founded a solo founder that made a similar product to his idea in product hunt and said he would prove his passion for the problem by selling. They\u2019re now 50/50 and crushing it (didn\u2019t need investors because of revenue). \n\nIt takes time, too. \n\nA founder once told me after being terribly frustrated with trying to find a tech cofounder. They said, \u201cEd, it\u2019s like dating to get married but I\u2019m bringing my kids.\u201d I\u2019d never made that connection but so true. \n\nAlright, for the rest of you that have great cofounders, how did you find them? And for you tech cofounders, what do you need to see? How do you wish these founders would approach you instead?",

No you don't have \"kids\" yet. Or else why would you need a tech co-founder? By definition, \"founder\" means you are starting something. You are looking to build a future with someone, and maybe you have some interesting ideas about what they will create, but you haven't birthed anything yet.\n\nMaybe you have already done market-fit and outreach, but the idea is nothing without the capacity to make it real. If a non-tech founder struggles with this concept, they will struggle to work with engineers."

Have you tried to convince Maga, have you tried to convince people there's a better way to do certain things? Most people will rather be scammed (Trump Coin etc) then trying to work on a coin, that won't be a scam. So, yes, I might haven't got a lot. But I do know what I do have. It's very rare. Because I talked to many people, I know precisely what they're lacking. They can't believe that something can be different. Thus, I don't have to rush to the exit. Don't come to me about fintech, crypto. I can sniff out immediately what the goal is. Fintech is creating the same bad reputation as crypto. Maybe you find a co-founder for example, but the weakness is still there. I am not impressed. Even though nobody looks down on my wild ideas. They chose comfy, I chose soft collision. As long as nobody believes anything, I have all the time in the world. It takes only drops to erode a stone."

I think it really depends on the specifics of the situation and the person you\u2019re approaching. I mean, yeah, you gotta have more than just a concept written on a napkin, but it\u2019s also about connecting with the right person. My buddy found his cofounder just by talking about his idea at a casual meetup\u2014they clicked because of mutual interests, not some grand sales pitch or proven sales track record. \n\nSure, it\u2019s rare, but it shows that sometimes being genuine can work. For me, it's less about matching a business resume and more about the vibe and shared vision. Don't get me wrong\u2014having traction is obviously attractive, and if you can show that you\u2019re making moves, that\u2019s awesome. The hard part is that it takes time to find someone who sees the same potential you do.\n\nIt\u2019s similar to finding a job. Everyone wants it perfect right out of the gate, but sometimes you just find the right fit and work from there. And yeah, sometimes it feels like trying to spot a unicorn but there\u2019s more to it. We shouldn\u2019t discourage those who are genuinely trying to put themselves out there\u2014they just need to approach it with sincerity and some groundwork. Speaking from my experience, you meet all kinds and sometimes those genuine connections turn out to be the most fruitful. Just my two cents, for anyone who's new out there looking for partners. Maybe I ramble too much..."

The fact is, if somebody knew the opportunity space you were planning to work in as well as you do, they would already be doing it. As good as that advice is, nobody will understand your business the way that you do. \n\nI'd say that you need to be able to constantly objectively evaluate the work that you've done and pivot quickly.\n\nBeyond that, for you, \"Perfect is the enemy of good\".\n\nJump in. Both feet. It'll be the best and stupidest thing you've ever done."

                    "text": "You're stuck in a pretty common loop for early founders - good news, it has some easy solutions! This is most common for founders like you who are also capable builders, where the comfort zone is building things. \n\nLet me break it into 5 steps I use when working with Founders in this same rut.\n\n1. Start with the problem - not the product.  \n  \nBuilding a product in a vacuum leads to endless tweaking because you don\u2019t have a clear measure for \"success\". I push founders to identify a real problem that someone (ideally, a specific group of people) is struggling with. \n\nA good problem is:\n\n\u2022 Painful: It\u2019s something people *really* NEED solved, not just a nice-to-have.\n\n\u2022 Frequent: It happens often enough that solving it provides value and people are  reminded of its existence.\n\n\u2022 Specific: You can explain it in a single sentence, like: \u201cCollege grads struggle to track job applications effectively.\u201d\n\n  \n2. Talk to Real People\n\nFind potential users and ask them about their problems. I love Rob Fitzpatrick's \"Mom Test\" book for this. Talking to real people will give you clarity on whether your idea is relevant and what \u201cdone\u201d looks like - because you can assess how well or to what degree the current state addresses the problem. No more guessing if it needs more features.\n\n  \n3. Solve Just One Part of the Problem\n\nYour first project doesn\u2019t have to be complicated or perfect. It just needs to solve *one* aspect of the problem well. Really well.  \n  \nFor example:\n\n\u2022 Instead of building a full-featured job application tracker, start with a simple spreadsheet-like app that makes it easy for those college grads to keep tabs.\n\n  \n4. Validate Really Fast\n\nBuild the simplest version of your solution (an MVP) and test it with users to see if it actually solves their problem. If they use it, give feedback, or are willing to pay for it, you\u2019re on the right track. If not, adjust based on what you\u2019ve learned. Don't try to solve it all - learn one thing at a time and keep moving.\n\n5. Admit that done enough IS  done enough\n\nWhen users start telling you, \u201cThis solved my problem!\u201d or \u201cThis is helpful, but it would be better if it did X,\u201d you know you\u2019re making strides. These conversations replace the guesswork about whether you\u2019re procrastinating or improving.\n\n  \nSo, by starting with a real problem, you\u2019ll always know whether you\u2019re making meaningful progress because the goal becomes concrete - it's impacting that problem positively, if not completely. Keep it simple, stay focused on the problem, and let the outcomes be your guide!"
