The flavor is bold and smooth, and it gives just the right boost of caffeine to help me feel awake without overdoing it.\n\nMy mornings also include my dogs, my little alarm clocks! The moment I stir, they jump on my bed and make sure I\u2019m up, even if it\u2019s earlier than I planned (like 3 or 4 a.m. sometimes!). They\u2019ve become part of my routine, and honestly, their excitement to start the day rubs off on me.\n\nI\u2019m still working on making mornings less rushed. I aim for 7 a.m., but most days, I end up snoozing till 8 and just barely making it out the door on time. I\u2019d love to be able to wake up earlier, maybe squeeze in some exercise, and have a calm breakfast instead of rushing out with just a cup of tea.\n\nDo you have any tips for morning routines or favorite teas to help with an energized start? Let me know what works for you!",

The only feature it doesn't have that I think some of the other cheap ones do is being able to set a different alarm for weekdays and weekends simultaneously. I read somewhere that the biggest difference between these cheap ones and the nicer ones like the Hatch is that the audio on the Hatch is much clearer (i.e. it sounds like actual birds are waking you up rather than a recording of birds), but I don't care much about that. My recorded birds still sound nice and peaceful in the morning and the sunrise light aspect works great. Would recommend!"

The app for the most expensive models is not great, and the colors on the $60 version didn't feel as natural and lacked the same brightness. I found myself feeling better waking up on the mid-range one than I did the cheaper model, though the cheaper model was certainly usable, and I imagine most sub-$50 alternatives could do the same job."

                    "text": "Hey Mountain insect,\n\nMy top tip for waking up early is going to bed early. \n\nSeveral years ago, when I had my first daughter, I started waking up at 4am so I could go to the gym at 5am and be back by 7 when it was time for work.\n\nInvariably, this waking at 4am routine led to me passing out around 8:30-9pm. This was disconcerting for someone who used to consider themself a night owl. I tried to burn the candle at both ends for awhile, staying up late and waking up early, but it wasn't sustainable. Late nights began to lead to snoozed alarms, and I decided I preferred the gym to watching tv or playing video games.\n\nAfter two years of waking up and immediately slamming preworkout to go to the gym I will add this: do not use caffeine to wake up.\n\nIf you enjoy the effects of caffeine, don't take any until 30-45 minutes after waking. There are a number of reasons why you should do this, but the most notable is that it messes with your cortisol levels and makes you crash in the mid-morning. \n\n1. Go to bed early \n2. Make your alarm a pleasant song that begins quiet and builds to a level that wakes you up\n3. Don't drink caffeine until 30 mins - 1 hr after waking\n4. Make sure you have something enjoyable to look forward to upon waking. For me this was the gym but you have to find something that will, essentially, get you out of bed.\n\n\nI hope this helps! Welcome to the early risers club!"

Once that\u2019s your new norm, you can start trying to wake up earlier (if you want) to maybe take the dogs on a nice walk to start the day."

I would recite \"Eyes are open, feet on the floor\" over and over, and I would spend time pretty much rehearsing how I would wake up. I would set my phone's alarm to go off while I was in my bed, and actually go through the steps of eyes open, feet on the floor, lights on, go out to the kitchen and get a drink of water, then step outside for sunlight. Then I would go back to my bed and set the alarm to go off and rehearse it again. I did this a handful of times a day until it just became a habit and it's what I do automatically right when my alarm goes off now"

However, working is more than just a necessity; it\u2019s a chance to learn, grow, and build your independence. Earning your own money for the first time, buying things for yourself, and saving for your future feels incredibly rewarding. Sure, the thought of committing to a job can be intimidating, especially when you're unsure of what lies ahead. But often, the experience is more fulfilling than you expect. You meet people who make the day-to-day enjoyable, and they can inspire and support you along the way.\n\nInstead of focusing solely on passion, consider what skills or opportunities provide the most economic benefit and financial stability. Once you gain that foundation, you'll have the freedom to explore hobbies or passions more freely. Starting small can lead to unexpected paths, and those first steps might just surprise you.",

From helping make someone's life easier to making them laugh, there are jobs of All kinds out there that are NOT the typical 9-5 slog. Some people do seasonal work, some people do work where they travel often, some people work from home... there are All shapes of jobs out there. \n\n2. You are never Stuck in a job. If you plan your life properly, and have contingency plans, you won't be Trapped in a gig. And that's important. Knowing you are Choosing to stay at a job helps tremendously. That means some important wise things--not taking on massive debts, having savings and back up plans, not spending beyond your means, etc. Still.. The idea that if my boss did some great injustice to me I could walk away Today is important. You may decide to live with roommates to make rent cheaper, to not get tons of take out to eat up the money you were working hard to spend, etc. \n\n3. Some people find their calling.. Some people Don't. If you are like me and never found a job that was your True One Career Love and angels didn't blow trumpets the moment you were hired somewhere.. sometimes you find jobs you Like enough and fit into your lifestyle well. This is what I did. I like having autonomy, I like high pay, I like Not being management, I like having co-workers in the moment and leaving work at work. I work part time, so the high pay balances out to what someone working a 9-5 would make full time. My job didn't require tons of college debt.

I\u2019m a little older than you and, while it has been easier lately, the concept of being subservient to a corporation\u2019s and manager\u2019s goals for 8 hours a day every single day is still absolutely soul shattering. Not only that but if you work normal hours, you can never get anything done when you get off because all the important places are closed early and not open on weekends. 8 hours of work is just enough to kill your motivation to do anything for yourself outside of work too.\n\nIn my opinion, the work system is a scam built to ensure the working class never challenge the higher class.\n\nHowever, opinion aside, what I know is all of us are different and some of us are predisposed to want to be independent while others feel more comfortable being subservient. That\u2019s okay. You have to play on your characteristics as a person. Don\u2019t try to shove yourself in a box that you don\u2019t belong. Trust me, it will not work out great for you.\n\nBeing a \u201cbum\u201d is a construct of society. What it really boils down to today I think is being chronically unproductive or without dreams or goals of any sort at all. Or in the literal sense maybe you are out on the street. You are none of those. You\u2019re just a little confused and lost and that\u2019s okay.\n\nSo how do you fix? Well, there is no easy answer, but it seems like you are already on that path. Explore different areas of learning to see what sticks out to you and just keep increasing your overall knowledge. Spend mindful time with yourself and don\u2019t be hard on yourself as this will help you discover aspects of yourself that may not have been obvious before. Play to your strengths, not your weaknesses. Forcing yourself to work a full time job is a big ask when it\u2019s not meant for you. Maybe you\u2019d be better suited working that full time position at a company where you are your own boss and make more decisions for yourself. Or, start working on a project that you love that you think could make money eventually. Don\u2019t pressure yourself to do this or you\u2019ll burn out on your dreams. Eventually that passion project might make some money and then you do another and another and eventually you may even be completely self sufficient if you play your cards right.\n\nLastly, depression is actually a good thing and it took me a long time to understand this. It is telling you something is wrong. Something you are doing doesn\u2019t line up with you or your values. Explore that feeling, don\u2019t distract yourself from it. You may come to a very profound conclusion about what you want in your life that only you could ever know and not a bunch of strangers online.\n\nGood luck",

There are even more 'average' intelligence people who just commit to something and follow it through to success. It's not your intelligence that limits you here, its your commitment.\n\n**\"go against the normalized system\"** \\- there's more than one way to skin a cat, and there isn't just one 'right way'. The normalized system, especially today, is literally becoming a slave. Once you're locked into a career at a corporation, you get locked in and dependent on their salary/benefit package and at the mercy of their bottom line.  \n  \n**\"get called a bum\"** \\- do you need to own a house in the suburbs and have 2.5 kids? do you need a 40 hr a week job at one company for the next 40 years?

You don't NEED to produce, productivity (even this subreddit) is toxic. You're young enough to be picky, especially if you have the luxury of free rent with your parents still. \n\nScrew the people that call you a bum... find something that you get excited about and chase that. If you think machine learning is interesting, learn it to learn it, at least you'll be able to respond to the changing culture as we move forward.\n\nIf you're lucky, you have a brain that can let you commit and stay focused, so all you need to do is pick the direction. \n\nUnfortunately, from your description suggests you either have ADHD, or have fallen into the attention black hole that can come with being always online. That'll take some extra effort on your part to overcome, but it's also doable.\n\nLiterally, the best thing you can do is learn to get mindful about yourself, your life, your wants and needs, and to find a way to look for opportunities and to be optimistic.",

I\u2019ve learned things I never expected about computer science itself, but also about people. Once I understood the structure of programs (albeit likely much simpler than the ones industry professionals work on), I began to see people differently. In a way, we\u2019re like programs, each of us is a package containing classes that define who we are and objects that shape our unique abilities and challenges.\n\nTo someone unfamiliar with programming, a crashing program might seem like a failure. But to a programmer, it\u2019s just a bug waiting to be identified and fixed. I\u2019ve started applying this mindset when talking to friends who are working through personal struggles. Often, when we trace back the \u201cbugs\u201d in our lives (patterns or issues we face repeatedly) they stem from something rooted in our early experiences.\n\nIt might sound oversimplified, but I believe the simplicity is what makes this perspective powerful. For instance, I recently had a four hour conversation with someone I\u2019m very close to. At the time, they were spiraling emotionally without understanding why. Over the course of the conversation, they let down their guard and became vulnerable. They shared that they constantly felt the need to achieve more and couldn\u2019t relax, but they didn\u2019t know where that feeling came from.\n\nWe started tracing the pattern back through their life and pinpointed its roots in their childhood, right after their parents divorced. Around that time, they moved into their parent\u2019s new partner\u2019s house and had to share a room with a sibling, while the partner\u2019s children had their own rooms. They always felt a divide in how they were treated, which planted a belief that they weren\u2019t good enough. Once they connected those dots and viewed it from their adult perspective, they were finally able to let go of the pain they\u2019d carried for years.\n\nThat conversation happened four months ago, and they\u2019re now a completely different person in the best way. They still face challenges, but they\u2019ve developed tools to regulate their emotions and navigate life more effectively.\n\nThis might not directly answer your question, but I hope it offers a different perspective. Sometimes, the understanding we gain from our field of study can unexpectedly help someone else work through a deeply rooted issue. A single conversation can shift someone\u2019s trajectory in life, offering rewards for both parties that go far beyond what we typically expect from our day to day work."

There will be days and maybe years that will be extremely hard and you may lack good things. But it will be momentarily. \n\nBut as devote yourself in learning that time to make good friends who will be with you and hold you when you fall. They needn\u2019t understand your path but they should trust you and your abilities. And for that you must be skilled in at least one thing (maybe teaching). Your talk and actions should speak on your behalf even when you don\u2019t have anything.

Free and open source.\n* **TickTick** (cross platform) - fully featured task manager, calendar, habit tracker, pomodoro tracker, markdown note taker\n* **Olauncher** (Android) - minimalist text-only launcher. Free and open source. I still use this one several years later.\n* **Markor** (Android) -  free and open source text editor for local .txt files, .md files etc. Includes todo.txt format / highlighting.\n* **QuickEdit Pro** (Android) - the text editor I actually use for my single plain .txt file on Android. On the laptop I just use the default text editor that came with the operating system.\n* **SyncThing** (most platforms) - syncs my files between devices in a P2P connection.\n* **Unhook** (browser extension) - I only use Youtube for university lectures, so I block everything else with this extension.\n* **SocialFocus** (browser extension) - I only have Reddit as social media and I use this to block addictive elements of it and to set a timer to block Reddit altogether after a specific time.\n* **uBlock** (browser extension) - blocks ads, cookie notices, pop ups, and other annoyances that websites come with these days.\n* **Workflowy** (cross platform) - probably the best infinite outliner I've ever tried.

Another recommendation is TickTick, which provides a visual calendar for planning, a Pomodoro timer for focus, and habit-tracking. Plus, they offer a free plan available. Maybe you can try them and see which works best for you."

I combine it with a physical timed lockbox when I\u2019m at home.\n\nI\u2019m going to experiment with \u201cfreedom\u201d soon. It requires a subscription plan to actually prevent you from turning it off which I hate, but I\u2019m hoping it will be easier to use and that it\u2019ll solve my problems with getting distracted on my computer.\n\nIf anyone has any better screen time apps I\u2019d appreciate suggestions.",

It has been great as someone who has tried multiple different screentime apps. You can get discounts as a student or for financial reasons, but they will also extend your week-long free trial for a month if you cancel and want more time to test it out. They have one metric called \"dopamine hits\" which I found helpful because it illustrates the impact of specific apps (social or games) compared to more standard apps like safari or mail. Highly recommend it to anyone who struggles with their device use impacting productivity.",

Reading a real book takes time and is a challenge. If you purely want to get the information or the top 10 lessons then by all means. Long form text like a book is not meant to be shortened. If it's a real book you get sensory information such as touch (the cover, the pages), visual information when seeing the actual words on paper or illustrations, you have to struggle to focus (with practice you will), you have to have better recall to remember what was said several chapters before. You get to reflect and hypothesize with the author. You embed the knowledge over time. You are forced to discipline yourself to actually finish the book.",

I get really anxious in the silence and I do EVERYTHING with background noise whether it be music, a podcast, a show, or random videos. Additionally my homework is all online and I do a lot of it on my phone as well. But I always get sidetracked and scroll whenever I pick up my phone. It\u2019s gotten so out of hand, I\u2019ll stay up til 3AM every night with a headache from the screen, not even wanting to be on pointless apps but having nothing better to do. \n\nHow can I get off my phone more when the majority of my day surrounds being on it? I feel like I\u2019m kind of giving you a trick question but I feel so obsessed and I get so sidetracked even when I\u2019m just doing something for work.\n\n\n",

Start by setting boundaries\u2014like scheduling specific phone-free times, such as during meals or an hour before bed. You can also try apps that help limit screen time or block distracting apps when you need focus.\n\nFor tasks like work or communication, consider using a laptop or other tools instead of your phone whenever possible. And for social connections, plan in-person meetups or calls instead of constant messaging.\n\nIt\u2019s about balancing necessity with intentionality\u2014finding ways to use your phone as a tool, not a constant companion. Have you tried anything like this before? Would love to hear what works for you!",

Have a work phone and personal phone/ dumb your personal phone down, less apps. \n\n2. Charge your phone in another room over night, use a standalone alarm. \n\n3. Use a timer, I\u2019m only going on Instagram for X time. Could work. \n\n4.

It's easiest to have a calm mind in the morning or after a nap, so try to study then.\n\nMeditation can also produce a calm mind.\n\nAnecdote: Addiction psychiatrist Alok Kanojia (Dr K) went to med school where he learned that a calm mind is best for studying. So he studied 2 hours a day in the morning. The rest of his friends \"studied\" for 8 hours a day later in the day.\n\nDr K's way of studying was so effective that he actually received an award for it in the form of an academic excellence award. That's how good his grades were.\n\nCheck out his YouTube channel healthygamerGG where he helps people with problems similar to yours, especially people with ADHD"

For example, alternate days for personal projects, competitive exam prep, and hobbies.\n\nInstead of aiming for perfection in all areas, aim for consistency. Even 30 focused minutes on something daily can compound over time. Weekends don\u2019t have to feel wasted\u2014use family time to recharge and sneak in some light reading or brainstorming for your projects. Let go of the guilt; life isn\u2019t just about efficiency. It\u2019s also about finding joy and balance. You\u2019ve got time, but it\u2019s about using it intentionally.

Mine is set to 1 hour.   That's okay except that the 1 hour length is a bit elastic.   If I change the end time, the beginning time adjusts and gets pulled or pushed to reflect 1 hour.   I seem to have to do multiple taps to get appointment times to stick if it's more or less than an hour.\n\nGoogle chat and it seems recently that threads became a thing for my family chat.   Respond to something and it creates a thread and nobody gets notified.  Tap on the back arrow button while I'm in the thread and I get taken back to the list of chats I have rather than the root of the specific chat.  I'm trapped in that thread and can't message the group.\n\nI am yearning for the days of my Casio BOSS and Palm Pilot.   \n\nLow resolution screens with efficient design instead of abundant options on a high res full colour screen.  Set buttons to get me exactly where I wanted were nice with the BOSS.  Those things got stuff done and organized nicely but not so easy with sync and jumping through hoops for interoperability.\n\nIs there anything off the shelf for mobile that has a stable UI to do calendaring and communications?   I use an Android Pixel with NovaLauncher and a iPad with a cellular modem.",

So you\u2019re not alone in this feeling. \n\nIf you are seeking a hobby or passion, you may not know if you actually like something until you try it. Maybe every weekend you can give a new activity an attempt. Some examples can be something active (learning a new sport, practicing calisthenics, etc), doing something educational (taking a cooking class or learning a new skill, learning a new language, learning how to play guitar), trying out new coffee shops and restaurants, exploring more of New York or traveling to new places, volunteering at an animal shelter or for another cause, working towards a more long term goal such as marathon training, etc. \n\nIf you\u2019d rather focus more on saving for your future house, you can consider taking on side gigs, like DoorDash, Instacart, Amazon Flex, or something like Fiverr or Taskrabbit if you have a skill you can monetize. This may put you in a state of constantly working though which may not be what you\u2019re seeking. \n\nOverall, something that you enjoy and that benefits you physically, mentally, emotionally would be great. I don\u2019t think everything has to become a passion, just finding ways to grow."

In general the feature's either unsupported, or the app does support it, but comes with a lot of UI bloat and features that just make it too complicated. It's e.g. possible to do it in todoist, but it becomes a big mess when you have more than a few tasks, and I lose overview fast. It's more of a task management app than a simple to-do list/note app - but all I want is just Keep, but with multilevel lists...\n\n  \nThanks for any suggestions :)",

This also allows for the few times you actually need to use the app/site.\n\nNow, I was wondering if something like that existed for Safari/Chrome/Firefox?

It\u2019s all \u201cjust do it\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re procrastinating,\u201d which sometimes gets in the way of actually reaching your goals. I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t work hard; I just think it\u2019s important to make sure you\u2019re aiming for the right target before putting in thousands of hours. If your aim is off, it really doesn\u2019t matter how much effort you put in\u2014you won\u2019t see real progress.\n\nFor me, that\u2019s where productivity really comes in. Productivity isn\u2019t just about doing more; it\u2019s about doing what matters most. To figure out what truly matters, you have to make solid decisions about how you spend your time and energy. That\u2019s why I feel there\u2019s a science that doesn\u2019t get enough attention: the science of decisions.\n\nEvery situation you find yourself in, especially as a professional, comes from a series of decisions, whether they were made consciously or unconsciously. Decisions can make or break your dreams, and your end result is only as strong as the best decisions you make.\n\nD = {d1, d2, d3, \u2026 , dn}\n\nAt any given moment, there are multiple decisions you could make, even though they\u2019re not all equal. This means there is an ultimate series of decisions that lead to a specific goal, which is pretty fascinating. You probably won\u2019t make every decision perfectly, but you can definitely improve your odds of making good ones along the way\u2014and that\u2019s what real productivity is all about. It\u2019s not just working harder; it\u2019s working smarter.\n\nIf you want to learn more, I recommend checking out decision theory or reading the book Smart Choices.",

I still think actual work should be done 95 percent of the time, but a good decision could exponentially increase the effect of what you are trying to achieve.\n\nFor example, I once spent months on a new marketing campaign without testing the message or checking if my target audience actually cared. When I finally launched it, I realized it completely missed the mark. If I had taken a bit more time to validate my ideas, I could have focused that energy on something people truly wanted.\n\nSame goes for optimization, I was spend to many hours doing manual work collecting data. However when I took some time thinking about it, I realized I could spend a couple of hours coding a script doing it. Spend a couple of hours, but saved a couple of weeks.\n\nBut! There has to be a limit to how much you can optimize, law of diminishing returns sets in pretty quickly. Sometimes the ROI for optimizing is too low."
