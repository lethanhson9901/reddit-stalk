Too many people seem to think that \"AI\" is just another word for LLMs or diffusion-based image generation algorithms or whatever.\n\nAI is a huge, broad term that has [existed since the 60s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence).  It covers a lot of fields and techniques.  And while it includes things like ChatGPT, it also includes a ton of other stuff, including:\n\n* Playing chess or other games.  \n* Recognizing objects in an image.  \n* Procedural generating maps or images.  \n* Understanding and responding to natural language.  \n* Speech recognition.  \n* Email spam filters.  \n* Autonomous cars.  \n* Netflix recommendation algorithms.  \n* Language translation.  \n* Facial recognition.  \n* Story generation.  \n* many many more\n\nAnyway, both ChatGPT and No Man's Sky use AI.  This meme is technically correct.  (the best kind!)  The people who are mad at it are just mad because they've swallowed the techbro marketing speak and think \"AI\" only means LLMs or whatever.  Technically, [LLMs are just a subset of the field of Machine Learning, which itself is just a subset of AI.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AI_hierarchy.svg)",

This is posted in a subreddit called DefendingAIArt, which is primarily concerned with art generated using LLMs. The \"technical correctness\" *is* the problem here, they're obfuscating what they're actually talking about when they use the term \"AI\" by appealing to a broader, technical definition.\n\nTo understand what's actually being communicated we need to consider not just a technical definition of \"AI generated\", but also and primarily what the original OP thinks \"AI generated\" means, and what the intended audience thinks \"AI generated\" means, which, outside of the context of this specific smokescreen trick, is something very different.\n\nThe contemporary popular understanding of \"AI\" is more or less LLMs, and in particular, very large LLMs trained on unpermissioned datasets. That subreddit leans towards \"more\" given that the topic and the kind of content that gets posted there primes the reader to understand \"AI\" in this way. By using this smokescreen they are implicating tools and techniques that lack the properties which are being critiqued in the critiques they are trying to rebuff.

A company can save lots of money by replacing human work in these areas with LLM output, but they'll suffer for it when all their games feel like schlock because it's not about how good the AI models are, it's about the accountability in actually being creatively responsible for every part of the process. \n\nAccountability over intent is a good thing.

As long as you understand how to describe what you want, you can generate content every four seconds. If anyone on the planet can make art with no skill, no money, and no time incentives then no one should pay for any AI generated products.*\n\n*If you make AI content, you shouldn't put watermarks or any other defining \"symbol\" on the work. That prevents me from stealing it, making it useless. We're all ok with stealing other art, so don't get pissy when I steal yours*\n\n*The AI is the artist. You just told it what you want.*\n\n*AI content is a supplement to create content that time, skill, or money constraints prevent you from making. Don't let others gaslight you into believing that because you can't afford to hire an artist that your ideas just shouldn't exist, but also don't gaslight yourself into thinking it's higher quality than a real artist.*",

In BotW, it may be easy to forget that all these character models are in fact upscaled Miis, but when you look three inches to the left at Bethesda, and let me tell you people did not like those procedurally generated planets one bit, and when it comes to characters, people have definitely had things to say about how bad some of the characters look when they\u2019re made mixing and matching assets into model, especially the older it goes.\n\nLike if the argument here is that people like procedurally generated assets to defend art, no people absolutely don\u2019t. \n\nProcedurally generated gameplay can be a fun experience, but the art assets have historically always been a mixed bag. Hell, I can\u2019t think of a single person who\u2019s clicked on any character creator\u2019s randomized setting and thought \u201coh yeah, no adjustments needed for sure.\u201d Your Minecraft world? Oh yeah, you can make it your own but I know you take a look at where you spawned and immediately thought \u201cugh, why is there this ugly rift like gash here like 50 blocks away I am changing all of this.\u201d \n\nThe only time I\u2019ve seen people like procedural generation is either when the game gives them such creative freedom that they can clean it up and work around it (like Minecraft, terraria, etc) or where the procedural generation is so guided that it\u2019s never a question of if something is going to look bad to start (Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, Binding of Isaac, Dark Cloud)."

Photos allowed us to capture natural beauty, audio software allowed us to create new forms of music, etc. a chisel and a drill both allow us to make marks in marble but neither outright replaced things.\n\nAI (LLMs and stable diffusion, because when people say they \u201cmade X with AI\u201d: this is what they mean) doesn\u2019t do that. It REPLACES the need for effort and creativity. \u201cOh but I don\u2019t know how to make textures\u201d then learn. Start drawing and who knows: maybe you\u2019ll come up with ideas while making said textures to improve your game. \u201cOh but I don\u2019t know how to make music\u201d then learn. Maybe you\u2019ll find ways to make music that incorporate things that have never been done before. \u201cOh but I don\u2019t know how to write\u201d then learn. Continue this ad infinitum.\n\n\u201cBut why should I be forced to hire an artist if I don\u2019t want to learn\u201d because you\u2019re not only getting an artist: you\u2019re getting someone to bounce ideas off of. You\u2019re also giving people who are new to the industry a in-road for future career expansion. By hiring an artist, a writer, a musician: you\u2019re creating new talent and gaining team members. There are no negatives to hiring people or learning things yourself.\n\nLastly: AI is just a really bad business practice all around. Multiple studies done on the marketability of AI shows that products that are deemed as \u201cAI powered\u201d or in relation to AI usually bomb hard.\n\nSo in short: AI is nothing more than an excuse to be lazy. It does not allow you to improve and only hurts you when you use it. If you wanna make a game: then **MAKE** a game. Learn the skills or hire a team. Don\u2019t stop at the front door and complain that it\u2019s \u201ctoo hard\u201d.\n\nThis is why I\u2019ve made it mandatory that all new artists, writers, musicians, etc, who I want to hire understand that if they ever use AI: they are fired. I make sure that every artist I hire is an actual artist who understands how to draw, make music, write, etc. I will NEVER hire anyone who uses AI in any capacity. I despise it with my entire being as it takes something as human as the act of creation and expression and automates it. \n\nIt\u2019s disgusting.\n\nEdit: and before people try and \u201cgotcha\u201d me with \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t hire a shit artist\u201d yes I absolutely would. I would rather hire an artist with zero experience who\u2019s actually TRYING to learn how to draw than someone who just types a prompt into a machine to get an image.\n\nI do not care about saving money: I care about actually making something with my own hands.",

I'm the ex-AAA solo-developer of [AETHUS](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redidev), a sci-fi survival/base-building game set on (and below) an alien planet, which you'll explore to mine and gather resources to build up your mining outpost on the surface, while unravelling a dystopian narrative involving ultracapitalist megacorporations!\n\nI left AAA in May 2023 after 7 years at studios like R* North, Build a Rocket Boy and Splash Damage, working primarily as a Lead Technical Designer.\n\nI wanted to make a survival game that **didn't fall into the classic combat tropes** that seemingly every single other one does, where you kill everything in sight, build turrets to defend against hostile aliens, etc. \n\nIn AETHUS, the environment itself is the only moment to moment danger, and you will craft and discover new tools and items to overcome those dangers, upgrade your suit and your sentient AI robot mining drone companion, to uncover the mystery of what's going on in this place! You can take it all at your own pace, and there's a strong narrative to drive you forward and keep you interested.\n\nI've also been working to make the game as 'comfy/cozy' as possible without it being an outright cozy-only game. There are a TON of decorations (including functional ones, like furniture!) and the building system is designed to be as easy to use, but powerful, as possible. I've also implemented a lot of QOL features that other games often miss, like crafting and building from storage,\n\nOh, and if you like decorating your base, [you can place pretty much any item in the game as a decoration!](https://streamable.com/5eckhs)\n\nIf you like the look of the game, please feel free to [Wishlist on Steam and try out the demo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/?utm_source=redidev), or join us in the [Discord!](https://discord.gg/WJEBMYgpgt) where you can with me directly. I'm really keen on developing the game together and integrating everyone's ideas as much as possible, where they fit the vision.\n\nI'd love to answer any questions you might have about the game :)",

Solo as the story is really at the heart of the game and I think that only works best solo, plus I'm just one dev so multiplayer was out of scope for the first game!\n\nIn terms of obstacles, the world is the main antagonist - you need to manage your oxygen level while exploring, and navigate environmental challenges. Boiling hot springs, giant chasms, lava, etc!. Hunger and thirst are present but are primarily a buff-only system (with exceptions) like Valheim.\n\nResources respawn, and spawn in random, defined locations.\n\nController support is planned, as well as Steam Deck support (though it actually already works).\n\nPC exclusive for now, depends how the release goes!"

When there are multiple materials sometimes they get stuck on stuff. Ignore this if there is a drone upgrade that hoovers resources.",

A pixel on the \"Enigma Isle\" title should more or less be the same size as a pixel in the background. When you mix them, you get what's called \"mixels\" and generally looks bad, kinda like it does here",

Consider either removing it or maybe replacing it with, for example, a dark, wide palm tree in the foreground? \n\nA great start!",

            "author": "Bojack92160",
            "text": "I\u2019m beyond thrilled\u00a0: my free mobile game on Android and iOS has officially earned its first $2 through ads! It\u2019s not a life-changing amount, but it feels like a huge milestone after all the hard work I put into it. \ud83d\ude04\n\nFor fellow mobile game devs who are curious (or confused) about how ads work, I wanted to share the lessons I\u2019ve learned during my journey (yes, I\u2019m now totally an **ad expert** \ud83e\uddd0).\n\n**The Main Players**\n\n* **The User**: The gamer who plays (and hopefully loves) your game.\n\n* **The App**: Your masterpiece that shows some ads (not too much \ud83d\ude20).\n\n* **The Ad Networks**: The platforms providing ads, like Unity Ads, Google AdMob, ironSource, and AppLovin.\n\n* **Ad Mediation**: The middleman platform that decides which network\u2019s ads to show to maximize your revenue, like LevelPlay/IronSource or AdMob mediation.\n\n**How Ads Work in Mobile Games**\n\nThere are three main types of ads you can use:\n\n1. **Rewarded Ads** (Most $$$ \ud83d\udcb0): These are optional ads that players choose to watch (e.g., to get extra coins or revive a character).\n\n1. **Interstitial Ads** (Mid-range $$): These show up at natural breaks (e.g., between levels). They\u2019re unavoidable but brief.\n\n1. **Banner Ads** (Barely $): Static ads that sit at the top or bottom of the screen.\n\nWhen your app needs to show an ad, it requests one from an ad network. Once the ad is displayed to the user, the network pays you.\n\nBut\u2026 *how much do you earn per ad?*\n\n**Understanding eCPM (Effective Cost Per Mille)**\n\n**eCPM** tells you how much revenue you make for every 1,000 ad impressions:  \n**Formula:** (Total Ad Revenue \u00f7 Total Ad Impressions) \u00d7 1000.\n\nYou want this number as high as possible. Here are the four main factors that impact it:\n\n1. **Ad Type**: Rewarded ads pay the most, followed by interstitials, and banners.\n\n1. **User Location**: The U.S. has the highest rates, while regions like Latin America or some parts of Asia pay less. Europe and Asia are generally in the middle.\n\n1. **Ads Per User/Day**: The sweet spot is \\~10\u201315 ads daily per user. I don\u2019t know how players could watch this much ads in a single day, so this still confuse me.\n\n1. **Ad Network**: Different networks have different rates. That\u2019s where **ad mediation** comes into play.\n\n**What Is Ad Mediation?**\n\nAd mediation platforms connect multiple ad networks to your app and optimize which ads get shown, based on payouts, user location, and other factors.\n\nUsing mediation boosted my eCPM significantly. Here\u2019s my experience so far:\n\n* Without mediation (just Unity Ads): \\~$11 eCPM.\n\n* With LevelPlay (ironSource mediation, connected on Unity Ads, Google AdMob and IronSource): \\~$22 eCPM!\n\n**Some Insight (examples of eCPM)**\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of what I\u2019ve seen for rewarded ads:\n\n**For a rewarded ads the USA, it's around 13$,** while it is around 3$ in europe and 2.5$ in asia.\n\nFor banner: USA is at 0.6$, Europe at 0.2$, Asia at 0.15$ and (just for fun) Latin america at a splendide 0.04$ per impression.\n\nI won't discuss here on how to use it and where, since it is already a long thread, but of course, ads will impact the user experience (plz do not use banner ads at all, and use very limited interstitial).\ud83d\ude43  \nThere is a lots of resource on how to implement ads in your app online, so I will let you do your works. Good Luck for the solo devs willing to use LevelPlay Mediation, it\u2019s a pain in the ass to set up, documentation is NOT CLEAR at all.\n\n**Support My Game \u2764\ufe0f**\n\nIf you want to check out my game and give some feedback about anything (I\u2019m *starving* for it)\u00a0:\n\nIOS: [https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/zroad-survival/id6584530506?l=en-GB](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/zroad-survival/id6584530506?l=en-GB) \n\nANDROID: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SkyJackInteractive.ZRoad](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SkyJackInteractive.ZRoad)",

There are also a lot of clear lines giving the impression everything is out in the open.\n\n\nThe second image has a lot of cooler colors and no living flora or fauna. The building is also quite foreboding with tall spires and fog shrouding it in secrecy.\u00a0\n\n\nI think the biggest factor though is the simple lettering change. The original gave 80s action movie vibes whereas the second gives bow before your industrial overlords.\u00a0"

I removed that setting to make it easier to get the video, since there's some randomness on the enemy side of when they hit the button."
