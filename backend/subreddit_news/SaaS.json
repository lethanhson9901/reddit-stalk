If anyone posts crazy numbers like this \n\nand then says\n\n\u201ccheck it out here\u27a1\ufe0f fake url\u201d\n\nthey are lying\u2026 plain and simple. If you see someone claiming large numbers like this, they are phishing for more clicks/purchases.\n\nYou can tell based on their profile but 99% are fake, especially when if you were actually making that much, you wouldnt be searching for validation on reddit.\n\nI hope this makes sense, but like youve been told before\u2026\n\nDO NOT BELIEVE WHAT YOU SEE ON THE INTERNET\n\nGood luck building your SaaS and I wish all of you the best of luck.",

I used to rely too much on paid ads, and while they work, they can also be a money pit if you\u2019re not careful. Once I started automating outreach and getting more direct conversations going, things started to click.\n\nCurious\u2014what\u2019s your take on scaling outbound at this stage? Are you still heavily involved in the process, or have you built a team around it? Would love to hear how you\u2019re handling growth beyond the initial traction phase.",

First, instead of using traditional cold ads, build an *exclusive community funnel*. Start by running ads offering free access to a private Instagram group where members get insider tips or tutorials related to your SaaS niche. Inside the group, subtly position your product as the essential tool everyone there needs. Second, tap into *micro-moments marketing*. Create carousel posts or short Reels that answer hyper-specific questions or pain points your audience Googles but doesn\u2019t expect to find on Instagram\u2014this builds instant trust. Third, leverage *hidden lookalike audiences*. Instead of basing your ads on obvious customer data, create a lookalike audience of people following Instagram accounts that serve complementary (but not competing) niches, giving you a fresh pool of untapped leads.\n\nThese strategies are cutting-edge and rarely explored, so you\u2019re welcome to try them yourself if you\u2019re up for the challenge. But if you\u2019re looking for a proven approach tailored to your business, I\u2019ve already refined these ideas into a system designed to deliver results. You can experiment on your own or partner with me to make it happen\u2014it\u2019s up to you!"

First, instead of using traditional cold ads, build an exclusive community funnel. Start by running ads offering free access to a private Instagram group where members get insider tips or tutorials related to your SaaS niche. Inside the group, subtly position your product as the essential tool everyone there needs. Second, tap into micro-moments marketing. Create carousel posts or short Reels that answer hyper-specific questions or pain points your audience Googles but doesn\u2019t expect to find on Instagram\n\u2014this builds instant trust. Third, leverage hidden lookalike audiences. Instead of basing your ads on obvious customer data, create a lookalike audience of people following Instagram accounts that serve complementary (but not competing) niches, giving you a fresh pool of untapped leads.\nThese strategies are rarely explored, so you\u2019re welcome to try them yourself if you\u2019re up for the challenge. But if you\u2019re looking for a proven approach tailored to your business, l\u2019ve already refined these ideas into a system designed to deliver results. You can experiment on your own or partner with me to make it happen\u2014it\u2019s up to you!",

First, instead of using traditional cold ads, build an *exclusive community funnel*. Start by running ads offering free access to a private Instagram group where members get insider tips or tutorials related to your SaaS niche. Inside the group, subtly position your product as the essential tool everyone there needs. Second, tap into *micro-moments marketing*. Create carousel posts or short Reels that answer hyper-specific questions or pain points your audience Googles but doesn\u2019t expect to find on Instagram\u2014this builds instant trust. Third, leverage *hidden lookalike audiences*. Instead of basing your ads on obvious customer data, create a lookalike audience of people following Instagram accounts that serve complementary (but not competing) niches, giving you a fresh pool of untapped leads.\n\nThese strategies are rarely explored, so you\u2019re welcome to try them yourself if you\u2019re up for the challenge. But if you\u2019re looking for a proven approach tailored to your business, I\u2019ve already refined these ideas into a system designed to deliver results. You can experiment on your own or partner with me to make it happen\u2014it\u2019s up to you!"

These are huge considerations - if I spend a few hundred hours building an MVP, I want to be able to trust the platform I depend on.\n\nWebflow, because Memberstack runs on it. Make for API connections, again because Memberstack depends on it.\n\nSo Memberstack was the big unlock - it felt both powerful and easy.

            "author": "sergiogonai",
            "text": "Everywhere you look these days, there\u2019s a new \u201cChatGPT-powered\u201d app or tool popping up. Some folks can\u2019t stop complaining about how it\u2019s \u201cjust another wrapper,\u201d while others are busy building their own. So, what\u2019s the deal? Is it really that bad to have tools that simplify or repurpose ChatGPT for specific needs?\n\nHere\u2019s my take: It\u2019s *fine*. In fact, it\u2019s necessary.\n\nThink about Coca-Cola and Pepsi. They\u2019re both carbonated sugar water, but people still argue over which one is better. Why? Because they *market* differently, taste slightly different, and cater to different preferences. The same goes for ChatGPT wrappers. Not everyone wants to dive into OpenAI\u2019s web app and figure out prompts or advanced features. Some people just need a *tool that solves one problem*.\n\nFor example:\n\n* **DoNotPay** uses GPT to help with legal disputes.\n* **Replika** focuses on emotional connections and companionship.\n* **Jasper AI** is a writing tool specifically for marketing copy.\n\nEach of these apps takes the same core tech and packages it differently. And guess what? People *pay for that*.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the *real clones*. Have you been to the app store lately? It\u2019s flooded with ChatGPT-like apps that *literally* just slap a different UI over the API. Are they shady? Some of them, yeah. But they also sell. People download them because they offer something OpenAI doesn\u2019t: accessibility. Simple interfaces. No overthinking.\n\nHere\u2019s the truth: Not everyone *wants* all the fancy features of ChatGPT. Not everyone has time to figure out how to jailbreak it, create complex prompts, or integrate it into their workflows. A tool that does *one thing well* will always find an audience.\n\nPeople *need simple tools*. ChatGPT is great, but for the average person, it can feel like a Swiss Army knife with too many attachments.\n\nSo, why all the hate? Is it jealousy from developers who didn\u2019t think of the idea first? Is it annoyance from power users who think everyone should just use ChatGPT directly? Or is it just people being people\u2014always finding something to criticise?\n\nWe can disagree and it's ok! \n\nLet\u2019s discuss. Are ChatGPT wrappers overrated, or are they filling a gap that OpenAI itself doesn\u2019t cover? ",

Its not particularly a product to be proud of, as its someone else's work and as a business venture a risk, change, cost, low barrier to competition. Probably short term, can make money with limited investment.\n\nUsing AI to drive additional value can be a long term value proposition especially if the LLM itself can be swapped out rather than the core componet - mitigates all sorts of risk. Solving an actual business problem has more value imo.\n\nI'm actually also surprised more SaaS operators aren't training their own bespoke LLM using the open source ones as a basis.",

Furthermore, I believe there's untapped potential in leveraging human analysts' intelligence (A.I. = Analysts' Intelligence ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)) for stock valuations.

I see a lot of products giving out discounts when you churn, but now I know this I always tell my friends \"create an account and stop the subscription they'll give you a 50% discount\". I'm sure this could create some artificially high churn because of this. \n\n\n\nTrying to figure out if it's worth investing time here, if we should build a quick survey ourselves or buy a tool on the shelf (they tend to be surprisingly expensive). Or just focus our energy on building a better product so that people don't churn. Any feedback appreciated! \n\n  \nPS: We typically see a 20% user churn the first month, then this gets to \\~30% total churn on month 4, and then stable from there",

Monitor Customer Health: If they are already giving notice of leaving it's too late. How is your back end analytics? I would dive deep into what the leading indicators of churn and what were your customers doing (or not doing) 3-6 months before leaving. I would then chart those behaviors and start to create a customer health scorecard where you can preemptively identify churn and proactively intervene (send knowledge base articles, automated emails, etc)\n\n2. Onboarding: With such high churn on the front end how is your onboarding? How do you track adoption on your onboarding? There is a term called Time to Value which is basically how quickly your users get value out of the product. I would suspect there may be a something going on there\n\n3. Post Mortem Survey: IMO I find those hey we'll give 50% if you leave tacky beuase it makes me think why didn't you just give me that price to begin with? And now I feel like I wasted money. I would send an anonymous survey just asking for general feedback on why there are leaving and taking a look at the responses.\n\nMy 2 cents. Happy to answer any questions"

Trigger it during the cancellation process.\n\nDiscounts can backfire if they\u2019re overused. Try offering options like pausing subscriptions or highlighting underused features instead of just slashing prices.\n\nFor building vs. buying: If you\u2019ve got the dev resources, a basic survey is easy to build. Otherwise, tools like ChurnZero or Gainsight might be worth it if you need deeper analytics.\n\nThat 20% first-month churn sounds like an onboarding issue, focus on getting users to see value faster.\n\nIf you want to save time on churn reducing features, check out [PLG OS](http://plgos.com). we provide ready-to-use components that can help you reduce churn for your SaaS .

                    "text": "$10K for 1M followers *can* be worth it, but only if their audience is **highly engaged and aligned** with your SaaS product. The biggest issue with macro influencers is that their audience is often broad, and if they mostly do product reviews, their followers may not be in *buying mode* for your specific solution.\n\nInstead of putting all your budget into one big influencer, I\u2019d recommend **testing multiple micro-influencers** (10K\u2013100K followers). They tend to have higher engagement rates, niche audiences, and more trust with their followers. Plus, for $10K, you could get 5-10 micro-influencers, meaning more touchpoints and more chances for your message to land.\n\nAnother thing to consider: instead of spending $10K on a one-time post, I\u2019ve had *way* better ROI by **directly reaching potential users through Instagram outreach**. I automated it in a way that still felt personal, and the cost was a fraction of what I would\u2019ve spent on influencer marketing. If you want to maximize ROI, that might be worth testing before dropping big money on a single promo post. Happy to share more if you\u2019re interested!"

If your product is viraly, as I saw in one of your past comments, influencer, even micro-influencer marketing is not the avenue you want to go down yet. \n\nYour audience of smaller social media agencies have incredibly tight budgets and tend to use freemium tools -- like why should they switch from HootSuite, Sprout Social, Buffer, etc., to you? -- now before you go off on me -- I know you're not competing directly against these products. Still, these products have some analytics functionality built in. \n\nI'd do these things first: \n\nWEBSITE \n\n1. Your website needs to demonstrate more value \n\n2. You should have testimonials and case studies \n\n3. You should create urgency and have an offer   \n  \nORGANIC SOCIAL \n\nYou should become an influencer yourself -- CEO/founder influencers are all the rage right now, like literally every day start posting helpful content for your ICP \n\nSEO, AIO, Video SEO, Image SEO, Barnacle SEO\n\nGoogle search phrases related to your brand and aim to emulate and take placement from all the existing results -- including AI roundups \n\nIf you've got help on your team have them post as well\n\nIMPROVE YOUR PRODUCT and PRODUCT ONBOARDING  \n\nYou can have great marketing and CRO, but if your product itself doesn\u2019t drive adoption or usage you\u2019re going to have a bad time. Have solid onboarding flows, docs, email communications etc\n\nLINKEDIN DMS   \n\\- I've had a lot of success with automated personalized LinkedIn dms using dripify. Waalaxy and some others are out there as well. The message I send is like*: Hay \\[first name\\], I see you like this thing. That means you must do XYZ. I'm from \\[Company name\\], which makes you better at XYZ -- if this sounds helpful, give it a try/book a demo etc --* \n\nAll of the above is easier said than done of course. Building a product and driving adoption is extremely hard. \n\nMy vote would be to save your money for when you know PMF is solid, your website will drive conversions, and you have a high rate of product adoption after sign-up. \n\nbest of luck!",

Start building a presence there is LinkedIn is where your target is at.\n* Use Dripify to automate LinkedIn connection requests\n   * You can create cadences, A/B test messaging, import contacts from LI (having Sales Navigator makes a big difference), You can determine messaging, how many steps, how long it runs etc.\n   * Make sure you limit the outbound requests to start, there is a control in Dripify\n   * Be aware LI has a connection limit for both regular LI and Sales Navigator (I believe Sales Nav is 150 connections per user profile a week)\n   * Start with a basic connection request, don't make a pitch or ask in that 1st connection request\n      * Example\" I thought we could benefit from being contacted regarding AI, and effective prompting for LLM, chatGPT etc.\n      * Next, could be I am curious what is important to you as it relates the X, Y, Z,\n      * From there you can iterate and have CTA's if no response to the first 2\n* Make sure your domain is DKIM, SPF, DMARC configured for email campaigns, should you use them, make sure you have a warmer set up\n* Run account based or targeted campaigns, that actually add value, help who your targeting solve there pain points. Add value added info that might not be directed related to your product but is a pain point and or could potentially be in the same ecosytem. The play is to make you look and become a valuable resource/organic traction\n* Figure out where your target audience (ICP, Personas) where do they communicate, what information do they consume, what websites etc. How do they get that information.\n\nThat is some basic info, there is so, so, much more. Just some things from having 8 years sales experience selling Enterprise SaaS, On-prem, hybrid applications, with start-ups and larger companies. (workload/workflow automation, RPA, No-code, XR (MR, AR, VR), and Privacy software.

The idea is that you see a lot of generic advice for solo founders to the effect of \"create an SEO strategy\" or \"Start doing social media content\" etc. But those sorts of endeavors are only really impactful if they are done in an ongoing, perpetual way and one that reuses content across all channels.  Coming from my years of managing content and marketing teams, I have found that a unified, multi-channel marketing calender is the best way to manage this, but even creating a schedule and developing campaigns is something that takes some know-how.  So our product is designed to guide folks to build a strategy in an automated way that uses AI to fill in those blanks. We're still building this but the idea is that as a founder, you tell our App about your business, your experience level and goals, and instead of it just giving you some blog posts to copy to your CMS or something, it works with you to develop a complete, integrated strategy. \n\nHope that makes sense -- and yes, I am very aware I need to work on being able to deliver this pitch in fewer words :)"

We also learned that many platforms are slow and archaic and focus on the dollar more than the customer.\n\nWe take a different approach. Our platform offers only one plan. You get every feature and pricing is solely based on the number of contacts you have. We offer features like multivariate campaigns (A/B testing but with up to 10 variations) that cost more than $5k per month at Sales Force Marketing Cloud, yet isn't expensive to implement.\n\nYou will also find that everything is laid out logically, where you'd most likely expect everything to be. We also try hard to eliminate any stopping points, such as when you need to add a new field when importing your contacts. This makes you more efficient and saves us money on rendering a ton of HTML as you get to where you have to go.\n\nLastly, we're very transparent. We actually show you why an email bounced (the actual error), who reported you as spam, the exact timing of things, and many other data points other ESPs hide because it could make them look bad. We're as honest as they get, tell it how it is, and will take the hit if it's our fault. We'll even apologize and get the problem fixed ASAP. We never see that from our competitors.\n\nThe bottom line is that our goal focuses on a win-win partnership with customers, not the dollar. That has allowed us to grow fast, and be profitable. We're now in 88 countries, send millions of emails, and are critical to some of the largest companies in the US, and that's from that last 6 months of growth.\n\nCheck out [Tarvent ](https://tarvent.com)and let us know what you think.\n\nFor all you developers out there, we support transactional email via our GraphQL-based API so you can send emails from your apps with ease and get great reporting.\n\nAlso, we're looking for partners that we can refer customers to that can all refer customers to us."

First, instead of using traditional cold ads, build an *exclusive community funnel*. Start by running ads offering free access to a private Instagram group where members get insider tips or tutorials related to your SaaS niche. Inside the group, subtly position your product as the essential tool everyone there needs. Second, tap into *micro-moments marketing*. Create carousel posts or short Reels that answer hyper-specific questions or pain points your audience Googles but doesn\u2019t expect to find on Instagram\u2014this builds instant trust. Third, leverage *hidden lookalike audiences*. Instead of basing your ads on obvious customer data, create a lookalike audience of people following Instagram accounts that serve complementary (but not competing) niches, giving you a fresh pool of untapped leads.\n\nThese strategies are rarely explored, so you\u2019re welcome to try them yourself if you\u2019re up for the challenge. But if you\u2019re looking for a proven approach tailored to your business, I\u2019ve already refined these ideas into a system designed to deliver results. You can experiment on your own or partner with me to make it happen\u2014it\u2019s up to you!",

For the client rating filter it looks like when you select an option (at least on mobile iOS) it automatically checks the rest of the lower filter ranges as well. Maybe this already works the way I imagine it should, but as a user, if I select 4.0 and 3.0 rating clients only, I do not want to see clients with a 2.0 and above rating. The current UI behavior makes me think this is what\u2019s going on. IMO it would make more sense to not force lower threshold selections if this is in fact not how the filter works on the backend. Otherwise I\u2019m a bit confused on why there is a filter at all if it works essentially top down, where you can only filter out higher rating clients, but not lower.",

            "text": "Not sure if this is the right place to post this but I'll give it a go.\n\nI've owned and been running food businesses since 2020, I sold the last of the food businesses off in May last year. Since then I've been working on trying to start something more scalable, naturally I landed on tech.\n\nI toyed with many ideas until I landed on one I liked, however instead of building first, I chose to validate. The result is a waiting list of over 400 (soon to be) paying users, who have already signed up to a free trial, their details are in a Stripe plan, and when the free trial expires, they will become paying users... the product isn't built yet.\n\nAbout the product: Its a workspace tool aimed at small businesses, with the core feature being marketing tools (main focus) and management / productivity tools. I landed on the idea after thinking about everything I used to do for my businesses, and how useful some of those things would be to others.\n\nAs the title says, I am looking for a co-founder. Why a co-founder? Because if 5 years of business have taught me anything, its that a single pair of hands can only do so much.\n\nThanks and feel free to reach out.\n\n",

While that\u2019s inspiring, it\u2019s not always the reality for many builders starting out.\n\nI\u2019m building [Invoicer AI](https://aiinvoicer.in), a simple, smart invoicing tool for freelancers and small businesses. We\u2019re growing steadily, focusing on creating value for our users rather than chasing vanity metrics.\n\nSo, for anyone out there starting their SaaS journey:\n\n* Growth takes time.\n* Focus on solving real problems.\n* Don\u2019t get discouraged by flashy posts; most of the time, they\u2019re exaggerated or fake.\n\nWhat\u2019s your approach to growth? Let\u2019s keep it real and help each other build genuinely impactful products.\n\nWishing you all the best on your journey! \ud83d\ude80",

Inside the group, subtly position your product as the essential tool everyone there needs. Second, tap into *micro-moments marketing*. Create carousel posts or short Reels that answer hyper-specific questions or pain points your audience Googles but doesn\u2019t expect to find on Instagram\u2014this builds instant trust.

If you ask a great CEOs why they are successful, they will say \"I didn't quit\"\".\n\nKeep in mind that if by any chance you failed, it's not the reason to stop. Many great companies were a 5th or 10th or whatever Nth try of their founders to make something valuable.\n\nParaphrasing again: \"The skills of launching and operating a company is something unnatural to human nature, therefore, it takes time and effort to become good at it. No one was born a great CEO, they've learned to be one\". So if ever you will feel that you're not good at it, remember, that no one was good at it to begin with. They trialed and erred until that found something that clicked.\n\nSo, best of luck to you, and I hope that advice will help you keep going through hard times (if there will be any)!"
