                    "text": "The prompt provided was underprepared. For example:\n\n\nThe ai was asked to search, not told where to search. So getting upset it chose to use Bing is unfounded. You have to specify if you have a specific way you want them to search. Then the op asks the IS to provide linked in \"if available\". That is going to introduce hallucinations, and, shocker, it introduced hallucinations. Then op was upset they didn't verify the linked in profiles, which was not a part of the IS' instructions. All of this could have been fixed with better planning.\n\n\nBut even further, the prompt itself is inappropriate. What is a \"financial influencer?\" How does it know what to look for? Anyone who refers to themselves as such? The OP seems to be targeting traders. Why would they want someone who's financial advice is to throw your cash under the mattress? In the parameters OP defined, both are equal. So how does it create a boundary? What is a financial influencer? I bought a coke yesterday. Did that purchase influence something?\u00a0\n\n\nIt's just the classic mistake of tricking your mind into thinking it's more than a tool. Tools need definitions. You can't just say \"hey buddy do x\" and it just doe it for you without further instructions. Setting up something like this would have taken a few prompts just to introduce the definitions and concepts. It's like going to court, you don't just show up one day. What day? How many days? How do you show up? Where is court? It's more complicated than that and OP didn't approach it correctly.\n\n\nWith that said, frankly this CUA doesn't sound all that great. It sounds like one of those tools that they're rolling out a bit early to show what they can do rather than what they are doing now. If 4o gets to where it can bypass captcha, for example, that would be huge, and this seems like early attempts to do that. But watching it click around on Bing once every 2 seconds sounds awful lol.
