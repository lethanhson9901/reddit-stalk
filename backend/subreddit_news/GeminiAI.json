The palace is awash in an ethereal, icy blue light, casting intricate shadows that dance on the walls. She wears an ice-blue strapless gown, featuring a sweetheart neckline and a fitted bodice adorned with intricate snowflake patterns, the skirt flowing in sheer, ethereal layers. A shimmering icy cape drapes over her shoulders, complementing the tiara with delicate snowflake designs that crowns her head. Her Nordic blue eyes sparkle with magic, and ethereal icy effects swirl around her hands, hinting at her powers. The wide-angle HDR shot captures the grandeur of the scene, showcasing the intricate details of her dress and the palace's icy splendor, with a high-contrast color scheme that accentuates the princess's beauty and the palace's majesty. The image is rendered with path tracing and ray tracing, creating a hyperrealistic and cinematic visual experience. The scene is captured with a cinematic style, using a Canon EOS R5 camera with a 24mm lens to encompass the vastness of the palace. The princess's hands are gracefully moving, casting magical effects that shimmer and sparkle, further emphasizing her enchanting powers. The scene is surrounded by ice sculptures. Another busty princess, shocked face, with strawberry blonde hair styled in two braids that wrap around her head like a crown, sometimes with loose strands and a flower or ribbon in her hair, wearing a teal dress with a fitted bodice and a full, layered skirt, gold embroidery, a black corset-like front, and short puffy sleeves, also stands on the ice throne, her platinum blonde hair styled in two braids around her head and a small tiara adorning her head. She is building a small snowman near the throne. Olaf the snowman is standing on the arm of throne looking up at the princesses with admiration."
