            "text": "Effective immediately, **all posts related to X, including those for Grok, will no longer be allowed in** r/aiart\n\nWe want to make this decision clear: r/aiart is a space for creativity, inclusion, and community. Fascism, hate, and the ideologies that underpin them have no place here\u2014or anywhere. History has shown us the devastating consequences of such ideologies.\n\n**Millions of lives were lost in the fight to stop the spread of Nazism**, and we owe it to those who sacrificed everything to uphold the values of freedom, equality, and human dignity.\n\nAs AI artists, we are part of a forward-thinking, innovative space. It\u2019s our responsibility to ensure this community remains safe, inclusive, and free from associations with harmful ideologies.\n\nWe recognize that this policy may spark discussion, and we\u2019re here to engage constructively if you have questions or concerns. However, let\u2019s remain focused on what matters: fostering an environment where creativity thrives, free from fear or hate.\n\nThank you for helping us maintain a respectful and inclusive community.\n\n\u2013 The r/aiart Mod Team",
