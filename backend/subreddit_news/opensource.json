Documenso is also another good example, they're building an OSS alternative to DocuSign ($18B).\n\nWhat other open source projects are meaningfully competing in big markets?\n\nI'm building an open source alternative to Drata / Vanta (combined $5B valuation) so it would be cool to see who else is doing the same.\n\n[https://github.com/trycompai/comp](https://github.com/trycompai/comp) this is what I'm working on if you want to check it out",

It is hard to think of an IT niche where an open source project is not at least trying to compete with the corporate offer: 3d design, CAD, LLMs, virtualization, embedded solutions, various firmwares...\n\nNot all are competitive, but many went from \"lol what is this crappy student project\" into \"well at least it is free, I can use it for now\" and finally into \"it works well, why would anyone pay for these functions?\""

This means you can have 5 keyboards connected and have every one of them perform different actions, if you wanted.\n\nI personally use it to map keys on my external numpad to key shortcuts controlling features in my system. Some keys switch between sound output devices. One key invokes the system color picker app. Etc.
